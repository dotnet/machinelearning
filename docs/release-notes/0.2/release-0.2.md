# ML.NET 0.2 Release Notes

We would like to thank the community for the engagement so far and helping us shape ML.NET.

Today we are releasing ML.NET 0.2. This release focuses on addressing questions/issues, adding clustering to the list of supported machine learning tasks, enabling using data from memory to train models, easier model validation, and more.

### Installation

Supported platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (see [supported OS versions of .NET Core 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.0/2.0-supported-os.md) for more detail)

You can install ML.NET NuGet from the CLI using:
```
dotnet add package Microsoft.ML
```

From package manager:
```
Install-Package Microsoft.ML
```

### Release Notes

Below are some of the highlights from this release.

#### New machine learning tasks: clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that groups sets of items based on their features. It identifies which items are more similar to each other than other items. This might be useful in scenarios such as organizing news articles into groups based on their topics, segmenting users based on their shopping habits, and grouping viewers based on their taste in movies. 

ML.NET 0.2 exposes `KMeansPlusPlusClusterer` which implments K-Means++ clustering. [This test](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/78810563616f3fcb0b63eb8a50b8b2e62d9d65fc/test/Microsoft.ML.Tests/Scenarios/ClusteringTests.cs) shows how to use it (from [#222](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/222)).

#### Train using data objects in addition to loading data from a file: `CollectionDataSource`

ML.NET 0.1 enabled loading data from a delimited text file. `CollectionDataSource` in ML.NET 0.2 adds the ability to use a collection of objects as the input to a `LearningPipeline`. See sample usage [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/78810563616f3fcb0b63eb8a50b8b2e62d9d65fc/test/Microsoft.ML.Tests/CollectionDataSourceTests.cs#L133) (from [#106](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/106)). 

#### Easier model validation with cross-validation and train-test

[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) is an approach to validating how well your model statistically performs. It does not require a separate test dataset, but rather uses your training data to test your model (it partitions the data so different data is used for training and testing, and it does this multiple times). [Here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/78810563616f3fcb0b63eb8a50b8b2e62d9d65fc/test/Microsoft.ML.Tests/Scenarios/SentimentPredictionTests.cs#L51) is an example for doing cross-validation (from [#212](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/212)).

Train-test is a shortcut to testing your model on a separate dataset. See example usage [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/78810563616f3fcb0b63eb8a50b8b2e62d9d65fc/test/Microsoft.ML.Tests/Scenarios/SentimentPredictionTests.cs#L36). 

Note that the `LearningPipeline` is prepared the same way in both cases. 

#### Speed improvement for predictions

By not creating a parallel cursor for dataviews that only have one element, we get a significant speed-up for predictions (see [#179](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/179) for a few measurements).

#### Updated `TextLoader` API

The `TextLoader` API is now code generated and was updated to take explicit declarations for the columns in the data, which is required in some scenarios. See [#142](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/142).

#### Added daily NuGet builds of the project

Daily NuGet builds of ML.NET are now available [here](https://dotnet.myget.org/feed/dotnet-core/package/nuget/Microsoft.ML).

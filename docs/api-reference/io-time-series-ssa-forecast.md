### Input and Output Columns
There is only one input column.
The input column must be <xref:System.Single> where a <xref:System.Single> value indicates a value at a timestamp in the time series.

It produces either just one vector of forecasted values or three vectors: a vector of forecasted values, a vector of confidence lower bounds and a vector of confidence upper bounds.

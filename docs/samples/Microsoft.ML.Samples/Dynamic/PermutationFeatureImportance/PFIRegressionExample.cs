            // Let's dig into these results a little bit. First, if you look at the weights of the model, they generally correlate
            // with the results of PFI, but there are some significant misorderings. For example, "Tax Rate" and "Highway Distance" 
            // have relatively small model weights, but the permutation analysis shows these feature to have a larger effect
            // on the accuracy of the model than higher-weighted features. To understand why the weights don't reflect the same 
            // feature importance as PFI, we need to go back to the basics of linear models: one of the assumptions of a linear 
            // model is that the features are uncorrelated. Now, the features in this dataset are clearly correlated: the tax rate
            // for a house and the student-to-teacher ratio at the nearest school, for example, are often coupled through school 
            // levies. The tax rate, distance to a highway, and the crime rate would also seem to be correlated through social 
            // dynamics. We could draw out similar relationships for all variables in this dataset. The reason why the linear 
            // model weights don't reflect the same feature importance as PFI is that the solution to the linear model redistributes 
            // weights between correlated variables in unpredictable ways, so that the weights themselves are no longer a good 
            // measure of feature importance.

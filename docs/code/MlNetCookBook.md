# ML.NET Cookbook

This document is intended to provide essential samples for common usage patterns of ML.NET. 
It is advisable to be at least minimally familiar with [high-level concepts of ML.NET](MlNetHighLevelConcepts.md), otherwise the terminology in this document may be foreign to you.
The examples in this document make use of the dynamic API, currently the supported ML.NET API.
In ML.NET there is also a static API, that operates on the schema of the data, strongly typing the data type. 
That version of the API is considered experimental., more about it in the [Static API Cookbook](experimental/MlNetCookBookStaticApi.md)

The examples in this cookbook use the recommended and supported API for ML.NET known as the "Dynamic API."
For examples of the "Static API", an experimental API that operates on the schema of the data using strongly typed data types, please refer to the [Static API Cookbook](experimental/MlNetCookBookStaticApi.md)

## How to use this cookbook

Developers often work by copying and pasting source code from somewhere and then adapting it to their needs. We do it all the time.

So, we decided to embrace the pattern and provide an authoritative set of example usages of ML.NET, for many common scenarios that you may encounter.
These examples are multi-purpose:

- They can kickstart your development, so that you don't start from nothing,
- They are annotated and verbose, so you have easier time adapting them to your needs.

Each sample also contains a snippet of the data file used in the sample. We mostly use snippets from our test datasets for that.

Please feel free to search this page and use any code that suits your needs.

### General questions about the samples

As this document is reviewed, we found that certain general clarifications are in order about all the samples together. We try to address them in this section.

- *My compiler fails to find some of the methods that are present in the samples!*
This is because we rely on extension methods a lot, and they only become available after you say `using TheRightNamespace`.
We are still re-organizing namespaces and trying to improve the story. In the meantime, the following namespaces prove useful for extension methods:
```csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Data;
using Microsoft.ML.Trainers;
using Microsoft.ML.Transforms;
```

- *What is the [MLContext](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.ml.mlcontext?view=ml-dotnet)?*
The MLContext is a starting point for all ML.NET operations. 
It is instantiated by the user, and provides mechanisms for logging, exception tracking and logging, and setting the source of randomness.
It is also the starting point for training, prediction, model operations, and also serves as a catalog of available operations.
You will need one MlContext object for all your pipelines or inference code. 

```csharp
// as a catalog of available operations and as the source of randomness.
var mlContext = new MLContext();
```

- *Can we use `reader` to read more than one file?*
Absolutely! This is why we separated `reader` from the data. This is completely legitimate (and recommended):
```csharp
var trainData = reader.Read(trainDataLocation);
var testData = reader.Read(testDataLocation);
```

## How do I load data from a text file?

`TextLoader` is used to load data from text files. You will need to specify what are the data columns, what are their types, and where to find them in the text file. 

Note that it's perfectly acceptable to read only some columns of a file, or read the same column multiple times.

[Example file](../../test/data/adult.tiny.with-schema.txt):
```
Label	Workclass	education	marital-status
0	Private	11th	Never-married
0	Private	HS-grad	Married-civ-spouse
1	Local-gov	Assoc-acdm	Married-civ-spouse
1	Private	Some-college	Married-civ-spouse
```

This is how you can read this data:
```csharp
// Create the reader: define the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextReader(new[] {
        // A boolean column depicting the 'label'.
        new TextLoader.Column("IsOver50K", DataKind.BL, 0),
        // Three text columns.
        new TextLoader.Column("Workclass", DataKind.TX, 1),
        new TextLoader.Column("Education", DataKind.TX, 2),
        new TextLoader.Column("MaritalStatus", DataKind.TX, 3)
    },
    // First line of the file is a header, not a data row.
    hasHeader: true
);

// Now read the file (remember though, readers are lazy, so the actual reading will happen when the data is accessed).
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);
```

You can also create a data model class, and read the data based on this type. 

```csharp
// The data model. This type will be used through the document. 
private class InspectedRow
{
    [LoadColumn(0)]
    public bool IsOver50K { get; set; }

    [LoadColumn(1)]
    public string Workclass { get; set; }

    [LoadColumn(2)]
    public string Education { get; set; }

    [LoadColumn(3)]
    public string MaritalStatus { get; set; }

    public string[] AllFeatures { get; set; }
}

private class InspectedRowWithAllFeatures : InspectedRow
{
    public string[] AllFeatures { get; set; }
}

// Read the data into a data view.
var data = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<InspectedRow>(dataPath,
    // First line of the file is a header, not a data row.
    hasHeader: true
)		
        
```

## How do I load data from multiple files?

You can again use the `TextLoader`, and specify an array of files to its Read method.
The files need to have the same schema (same number and type of columns) 

[Example file1](../../test/data/adult.train):
[Example file2](../../test/data/adult.test):
```
Label	Workclass	education	marital-status
0	Private	11th	Never-married
0	Private	HS-grad	Married-civ-spouse
1	Local-gov	Assoc-acdm	Married-civ-spouse
1	Private	Some-college	Married-civ-spouse
```

This is how you can read this data:

```csharp

// Create the reader: define the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextReader(new[] {
        // A boolean column depicting the 'label'.
        new TextLoader.Column("IsOver50K", DataKind.BL, 0),
        // Three text columns.
        new TextLoader.Column("Workclass", DataKind.TX, 1),
        new TextLoader.Column("Education", DataKind.TX, 2),
        new TextLoader.Column("MaritalStatus", DataKind.TX, 3)
    },
    // First line of the file is a header, not a data row.
    hasHeader: true
);

var data = reader.Read(exampleFile1, exampleFile2);
```
## How do I load data with many columns from a CSV?
`TextLoader` is used to load data from text files. You will need to specify what are the data columns, what are their types, and where to find them in the text file. 

When the input file contains many columns of the same type, always intended to be used together, we recommend reading them as a *vector column* from the very start: this way the schema of the data is cleaner, and we don't incur unnecessary performance costs.

[Example file](../../test/data/generated_regression_dataset.csv):
```
-2.75,0.77,-0.61,0.14,1.39,0.38,-0.53,-0.50,-2.13,-0.39,0.46,140.66
-0.61,-0.37,-0.12,0.55,-1.00,0.84,-0.02,1.30,-0.24,-0.50,-2.12,148.12
-0.85,-0.91,1.81,0.02,-0.78,-1.41,-1.09,-0.65,0.90,-0.37,-0.22,402.20
0.28,1.05,-0.24,0.30,-0.99,0.19,0.32,-0.95,-1.19,-0.63,0.75,443.51
```

Reading this file using `TextLoader`:

```csharp
// Create the reader: define the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextReader(new[] {
        // We read the first 10 values as a single float vector.
        new TextLoader.Column("FeatureVector", DataKind.R4, new[] {new TextLoader.Range(0, 10)}),
        // Separately, read the target variable.
        new TextLoader.Column("Target", DataKind.R4, 11)
    },
    // Default separator is tab, but we need a comma.
    separatorChar: ',');

// Now read the file (remember though, readers are lazy, so the actual reading will happen when the data is accessed).
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);
```

Or by creating a data model for it:

```csharp
private class AdultData
{
    [LoadColumn(0, 10), ColumnName("Features")]
    public float FeatureVector { get; set;}

    [LoadColumn(11)]
    public float Target { get; set;}
}

// Read the data into a data view.
var trainData = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<AdultData>(trainDataPath,
                // Default separator is tab, but we need a semicolon.
                separatorChar: ';',
                // First line of the file is a header, not a data row.
                hasHeader: true
);		

```

## How do I debug my experiment or preview my pipeline?

Most ML.NET data operations are 'lazy': when declared, the operators do not immediately process data, but rather validate that the operation is possible. 
Execution is deferred until the output data is actually requested. This means that a schema mismatch will throw at declaration time, but a data error will not throw until execution time. 
Lazy computation is a trick from database systems that allows for performance optimization in evaluating pipelines, but does make it more difficult to step through and debug an experiment.

In order to improve debug-ability, we have added a `Preview()` extension method to all data views, transformers, estimators and readers:

- `Preview` of a data view contains first 100 rows (configurable) of the data view, encoded as objects, in a single in-memory structure.
- `Preview` of a transformer takes data as input, and outputs the preview of the transformed data.
- `Preview` of an estimator also takes data as input, fits an 'approximated model' on the first 100 rows (configurable) of data, and then outputs the preview of the resulting transformer.

We tried to make `Preview` debugger-friendly: our expectation is that, if you enter, say `data.Preview()` in your Watch window, you will be able to easily inspect the data there.

Here is the code sample:
```csharp
var estimator = mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.MapValueToKey("Label")
    .Append(mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.StochasticDualCoordinateAscent())
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue("PredictedLabel"));

var data = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile(new TextLoader.Column[] {
    new TextLoader.Column("Label", DataKind.Text, 0),
    new TextLoader.Column("Features", DataKind.R4, 1, 4) }, filePath);

// Preview the data. 
var dataPreview = data.Preview();

// Preview the result of training and transformation.
var transformationPreview = estimator.Preview(data);
```

## How do I look at the intermediate data?

Oftentimes, when we construct the experiment, we want to make sure that the data processing 'up to a certain moment' produces the results that we want. With ML.NET it is not very easy to do: since all ML.NET operations are lazy, the objects we construct are just 'promises' of data.

We will need to create the cursor and scan the data to obtain the actual values. One way to do this is to use [schema comprehension](SchemaComprehension.md) and map the data to an `IEnumerable` of user-defined objects.

Another mechanism that lets you inspect the intermediate data is the `GetColumn<T>` extension method. It lets you look at the contents of one column of your data in a form of an `IEnumerable`.

Here is all of this in action:

[Example file](../../test/data/adult.tiny.with-schema.txt):
```
Label	Workclass	education	marital-status
0	Private	11th	Never-married
0	Private	HS-grad	Married-civ-spouse
1	Local-gov	Assoc-acdm	Married-civ-spouse
1	Private	Some-college	Married-civ-spouse

```

```csharp
// Read the data into a data view.
var data = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<InspectedRow>(dataPath,
    // First line of the file is a header, not a data row.
    hasHeader: true
);

// Start creating our processing pipeline. For now, let's just concatenate all the text columns
// together into one.
var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("AllFeatures", "Education", "MaritalStatus");

// Fit our data pipeline and transform data with it.
var transformedData = pipeline.Fit(data).Transform(data);

// 'transformedData' is a 'promise' of data. Let's actually read it.
var someRows = mlContext
    // Convert to an enumerable of user-defined type. 
    .CreateEnumerable<InspectedRowWithAllFeatures>(transformedData, reuseRowObject: false)
    // Take a couple values as an array.
    .Take(4).ToArray();

// Extract the 'AllFeatures' column.
// This will give the entire dataset: make sure to only take several row
// in case the dataset is huge. The is similar to the static API, except
// you have to specify the column name and type.
var featureColumns = transformedData.GetColumn<string[]>(mlContext, "AllFeatures")
    .Take(20).ToArray();
```
## How do I train a regression model?

Generally, in order to train any model in ML.NET, you will go through three steps:
1. Figure out how the training data gets into ML.NET in a form of an `IDataView`
2. Build the 'learning pipeline' as a sequence of elementary 'operators' (estimators).
3. Call `Fit` on the pipeline to obtain the trained model.

[Example file](../../test/data/generated_regression_dataset.csv):
```
feature_0;feature_1;feature_2;feature_3;feature_4;feature_5;feature_6;feature_7;feature_8;feature_9;feature_10;target
-2.75;0.77;-0.61;0.14;1.39;0.38;-0.53;-0.50;-2.13;-0.39;0.46;140.66
-0.61;-0.37;-0.12;0.55;-1.00;0.84;-0.02;1.30;-0.24;-0.50;-2.12;148.12
-0.85;-0.91;1.81;0.02;-0.78;-1.41;-1.09;-0.65;0.90;-0.37;-0.22;402.20
```

In the file above, the last column (12th) is label that we predict, and all the preceding ones are features.

```csharp
// Step one: read the data as an IDataView.
// First, we define the reader: specify the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
// Read the data into a data view. Remember though, readers are lazy, so the actual reading will happen when the data is accessed.
var trainData = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<AdultData>(dataPath,
    // Default separator is tab, but the dataset has comma.
    separatorChar: ','
);

// Sometime, caching data in-memory after its first access can save some loading time when the data is going to be used
// several times somewhere. The caching mechanism is also lazy; it only caches things after being used.
// User can replace all the subsequently uses of "trainData" with "cachedTrainData". We still use "trainData" because
// a caching step, which provides the same caching function, will be inserted in the considered "pipeline."
var cachedTrainData = mlContext.Data.Cache(trainData);

// Step two: define the learning pipeline. 

// We 'start' the pipeline with the output of the reader.
var pipeline =
    // First 'normalize' the data (rescale to be
    // between -1 and 1 for all examples)
    mlContext.Transforms.Normalize("FeatureVector")
    // We add a step for caching data in memory so that the downstream iterative training
    // algorithm can efficiently scan through the data multiple times. Otherwise, the following
    // trainer will read data from disk multiple times. The caching mechanism uses an on-demand strategy.
    // The data accessed in any downstream step will be cached since its first use. In general, you only
    // need to add a caching step before trainable step, because caching is not helpful if the data is
    // only scanned once. This step can be removed if user doesn't have enough memory to store the whole
    // data set. Notice that in the upstream Transforms.Normalize step, we only scan through the data 
    // once so adding a caching step before it is not helpful.
    .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)
    // Add the SDCA regression trainer.
    .Append(mlContext.Regression.Trainers.StochasticDualCoordinateAscent(labelColumnName: "Target", featureColumnName: "FeatureVector"));

// Step three. Fit the pipeline to the training data.
var model = pipeline.Fit(trainData);
```
## How do I verify the model quality?

This is the first question that arises after you train the model: how good it actually is?
For each of the machine learning tasks, there is a set of 'metrics' that can describe how good the model is: it could be log-loss or F1 score for classification, RMS or L1 loss for regression etc.

You can use the corresponding 'context' of the task to evaluate the model.

Assuming the example above was used to train the model, here's how you calculate the metrics.

```csharp
// Read the test dataset.
var testData = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<AdultData>(testDataPath,
    // Default separator is tab, but the dataset has comma.
    separatorChar: ','
);
// Calculate metrics of the model on the test data.
var metrics = mlContext.Regression.Evaluate(model.Transform(testData), label: "Target");
```

## How do I save and load the model?

Assuming that the model metrics look good to you, it's time to 'operationalize' the model. This is where ML.NET really shines: the `model` object you just built is ready for immediate consumption, it will apply all the same steps that it has 'learned' during training, and it can be persisted and reused in different environments.

Here's what you do to save the model to a file, and reload it (potentially in a different context).

```csharp
using (var stream = File.Create(modelPath))
{
    mlContext.Model.Save(model, stream);
}

// Potentially, the lines below can be in a different process altogether.
ITransformer loadedModel;
using (var stream = File.OpenRead(modelPath))
    loadedModel = mlContext.Model.Load(stream);
```
## How do I use the model to make one prediction?

Since any ML.NET model is a transformer, you can of course use `model.Transform` to apply the model to the 'data view' and obtain predictions this way. 

A more typical case, though, is when there is no 'dataset' that we want to predict on, but instead we receive one example at a time. For instance, we run the model as part of the ASP.NET website, and we need to make a prediction for an incoming HTTP request.

For this case, ML.NET offers a convenient `PredictionEngine` component, that essentially runs one example at a time through the prediction pipeline. 

Here is the full example. Let's imagine that we have built a model for the famous Iris prediction dataset:

```csharp
// Step one: read the data as an IDataView.
 //  Retrieve the training data.
var trainData = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<IrisInput>(irisDataPath,
    // Default separator is tab, but the dataset has comma.
    separatorChar: ','
);

// Build the training pipeline.
var pipeline =
    // Concatenate all the features together into one column 'Features'.
    mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "SepalLength", "SepalWidth", "PetalLength", "PetalWidth")
    // Note that the label is text, so it needs to be converted to key.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.MapValueToKey("Label"), TransformerScope.TrainTest)
    // Cache data in memory for steps after the cache check point stage.
    .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)
    // Use the multi-class SDCA model to predict the label using features.
    .Append(mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.StochasticDualCoordinateAscent())
    // Apply the inverse conversion from 'PredictedLabel' column back to string value.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue(("PredictedLabel", "Data")));

// Train the model.
var model = pipeline.Fit(trainData);
```

Now, in order to use [schema comprehension](SchemaComprehension.md) for prediction, we define a pair of classes like following:
```csharp
private class IrisInput
{
    // Unfortunately, we still need the dummy 'Label' column to be present.
    [ColumnName("Label")]
    public string IgnoredLabel { get; set; }
    public float SepalLength { get; set; }
    public float SepalWidth { get; set; }
    public float PetalLength { get; set; }
    public float PetalWidth { get; set; }
}

private class IrisPrediction
{
    [ColumnName("Data")]
    public string PredictedClass { get; set; }
}
```

The prediction code now looks as follows:
```csharp
// Use the model for one-time prediction.
// Make the prediction function object. Note that, on average, this call takes around 200x longer
// than one prediction, so you might want to cache and reuse the prediction function, instead of
// creating one per prediction.
var predictionFunc = model.CreatePredictionEngine<IrisInput, IrisPrediction>(mlContext);

// Obtain the prediction. Remember that 'Predict' is not reentrant. If you want to use multiple threads
// for simultaneous prediction, make sure each thread is using its own PredictionEngine.
var prediction = predictionFunc.Predict(new IrisInput
{
    SepalLength = 4.1f,
    SepalWidth = 0.1f,
    PetalLength = 3.2f,
    PetalWidth = 1.4f
});
```

## What if my training data is not in a text file?

The commonly demonstrated use case for ML.NET is when the training data resides somewhere on disk, and we use the `TextLoader` to read it.
However, in real-time training scenarios the training data can be elsewhere: in a bunch of SQL tables, extracted from log files, or even generated on the fly.

Here is how we can use [schema comprehension](SchemaComprehension.md) to bring an existing C# `IEnumerable` into ML.NET as a data view.

For the purpose of this example, we will assume that we build the customer churn prediction model, and we can extract the following features from our production system:
- Customer ID (ignored by the model)
- Whether the customer has churned (the target 'label')
- The 'demographic category' (one string, like 'young adult' etc.)
- The number of visits from the last 5 days.
```csharp
private class CustomerChurnInfo
{
    public string CustomerID { get; set; }
    public bool HasChurned { get; set; }
    public string DemographicCategory { get; set; }
    // Visits during last 5 days, latest to newest.
    [VectorType(5)]
    public float[] LastVisits { get; set; }
}
```

Given this information, here's how we turn this data into the ML.NET data view and train on it:
```csharp
// Step one: read the data as an IDataView.
// Let's assume that 'GetChurnData()' fetches and returns the training data from somewhere.
IEnumerable<CustomerChurnInfo> churnData = GetChurnInfo();

// Step one: read the data as an IDataView.
// Let's assume that 'GetChurnData()' fetches and returns the training data from somewhere.
var trainData = mlContext.Data.ReadFromEnumerable(churnData);

// Build the learning pipeline. 
// In our case, we will one-hot encode the demographic category, and concatenate that with the number of visits.
// We apply our FastTree binary classifier to predict the 'HasChurned' label.

var pipeline =
    // Convert each categorical feature into one-hot encoding independently.
    mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding("CategoricalOneHot", "CategoricalFeatures")
    // Convert all categorical features into indices, and build a 'word bag' of these.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding("CategoricalBag", "CategoricalFeatures", OneHotEncodingTransformer.OutputKind.Bag))
    // One-hot encode the workclass column, then drop all the categories that have fewer than 10 instances in the train set.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding("WorkclassOneHot", "Workclass"))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.FeatureSelection.SelectFeaturesBasedOnCount("WorkclassOneHotTrimmed", "WorkclassOneHot", count: 10));

var model = pipeline.Fit(trainData);
```

## I want to look at my model's coefficients

Oftentimes, once a model is trained, we are also interested on 'what it has learned'. 

For example, if the linear model assigned zero weight to a feature that we consider important, it could indicate some problem with modeling. The weights of the linear model can also be used as a poor man's estimation of 'feature importance'.

We provide a set of `onFit` delegates that allow introspection of the individual transformers as they are trained.

This is how we can extract the learned parameters out of the model that we trained:
```csharp

// Step one: read the data as an IDataView.
//  Retrieve the training data.
var trainData = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<IrisInput>(irisDataPath,
    // Default separator is tab, but the dataset has comma.
    separatorChar: ','
);

// Build the training pipeline.
var pipeline =
    // Concatenate all the features together into one column 'Features'.
    mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "SepalLength", "SepalWidth", "PetalLength", "PetalWidth")
    // Note that the label is text, so it needs to be converted to key.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapValueToKey("Label"), TransformerScope.TrainTest)
    // Cache data in memory for steps after the cache check point stage.
    .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)
    // Use the multi-class SDCA model to predict the label using features.
    .Append(mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.StochasticDualCoordinateAscent());

// Train the model.
var trainedModel = pipeline.Fit(trainData);

// Inspect the model parameters. 
var modelParameters = trainedModel.LastTransformer.Model as MulticlassLogisticRegressionModelParameters;

// Now we can use 'modelParameters' to look at the weights.
// 'weights' will be an array of weight vectors, one vector per class.
// Our problem has 3 classes, so numClasses will be 3, and weights will contain
// 3 vectors (of 4 values each).
VBuffer<float>[] weights = default;
modelParameters.GetWeights(ref weights, out int numClasses);

// numClasses
// 3

## What is normalization and why do I need to care?

In ML.NET we expose a number of [parametric and non-parametric algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/parametric-and-nonparametric-machine-learning-algorithms/).

Typically, parametric learners hold certain assumptions about the training data, and if they are not met, the training is greatly hampered (or sometimes becomes completely impossible).

Most commonly, the assumptions are that
- All the features have values roughly on the same scale;
- Feature values are not too large, and not too small.

Violating the first assumption above can cause the learner to train a sub-optimal model (or even a completely useless one). Violating the second assumption can cause arithmetic error accumulation, which typically breaks the training process altogether.

As a general rule, *if you use a parametric learner, you need to make sure your training data is correctly scaled*. 

ML.NET offers several built-in scaling algorithms, or 'normalizers':
- MinMax normalizer: for each feature, we learn the minimum and maximum value of it, and then linearly rescale it so that the values fit between -1 and 1.
- MeanVar normalizer: for each feature, compute the mean and variance, and then linearly rescale it to zero-mean, unit-variance.
- CDF normalizer: for each feature, compute the mean and variance, and then replace each value `x` with `Cdf(x)`, where `Cdf` is the cumulative density function of normal distribution with these mean and variance. 
- Binning normalizer: discretize the feature value into `N` 'buckets', and then replace each value with the index of the bucket, divided by `N-1`.

These normalizers all have different properties and tradeoffs, but it's not *that* big of a deal if you use one over another. Just make sure you use a normalizer when training linear models or other parametric models. 

An important parameter of ML.NET normalizers is called `fixZero`. If `fixZero` is true, zero input is always mapped to zero output. This is very important when you handle sparse data: if we don't preserve zeroes, we will turn all sparse data into dense, which is usually a bad idea.

It is a good practice to include the normalizer directly in the ML.NET learning pipeline: this way you are sure that the normalization
- is only trained on the training data, and not on your test data,
- is correctly applied to all the new incoming data, without the need for extra pre-processing at prediction time.

Here's a snippet of code that demonstrates normalization in learning pipelines. It assumes the Iris dataset:

```csharp
//data model for the Iris class
 private class IrisInputAllFeatures
{
    [ColumnName("Label"), LoadColumn(4)]
    public string IgnoredLabel { get; set; }

    [LoadColumn(0, 3)]
    public float Features { get; set; }
}

// Read the training data.
var trainData = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<IrisInputAllFeatures>(dataPath,
    // Default separator is tab, but the dataset has comma.
    separatorChar: ','
);

// Apply all kinds of standard ML.NET normalization to the raw features.
var pipeline =
    mlContext.Transforms.Normalize(
        new NormalizingEstimator.MinMaxColumnOptions("MinMaxNormalized", "Features", fixZero: true),
        new NormalizingEstimator.MeanVarColumnOptions("MeanVarNormalized", "Features", fixZero: true),
        new NormalizingEstimator.BinningColumnOptions("BinNormalized", "Features", numBins: 256));

// Let's train our pipeline of normalizers, and then apply it to the same data.
var normalizedData = pipeline.Fit(trainData).Transform(trainData);

// Inspect one column of the resulting dataset.
var meanVarValues = normalizedData.GetColumn<float[]>(mlContext, "MeanVarNormalized").ToArray();
```

## How do I train my model on categorical data?

Generally speaking, *all ML.NET learners expect the features as a float vector*. So, if some of your data is not natively a float, you will need to convert to floats. 

If our data contains 'categorical' features (think 'enum'), we need to 'featurize' them somehow. ML.NET offers several ways of converting categorical data to features:
- One-hot encoding
- Hash-based one-hot encoding
- Binary encoding (convert category index into a bit sequence and use bits as features)

If some of the categories are very high-cardinality (there's lots of different values, but only several are commonly occurring), a one-hot encoding can be wasteful. We can use count-based feature selection to trim down the number of slots that we encode.

Same with normalization, it's a good practice to include categorical featurization directly in the ML.NET learning pipeline: this way you are sure that the categorical transformation
- is only 'trained' on the training data, and not on your test data,
- is correctly applied to all the new incoming data, without the need for extra pre-processing at prediction time.

Below is an example of categorical handling for the [adult census dataset](../../test/data/adult.tiny.with-schema.txt):
```
Label	Workclass	education	marital-status	occupation	relationship	ethnicity	sex	native-country-region	age	fnlwgt	education-num	capital-gain	capital-loss	hours-per-week
0	Private	11th	Never-married	Machine-op-inspct	Own-child	Black	Male	United-States	25	226802	7	0	0	40
0	Private	HS-grad	Married-civ-spouse	Farming-fishing	Husband	White	Male	United-States	38	89814	9	0	0	50
1	Local-gov	Assoc-acdm	Married-civ-spouse	Protective-serv	Husband	White	Male	United-States	28	336951	12	0	0	40
1	Private	Some-college	Married-civ-spouse	Machine-op-inspct	Husband	Black	Male	United-States	44	160323	10	7688	0	40
```

```csharp
// Define the reader: specify the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextReader(new[] 
    {
        new TextLoader.Column("Label", DataKind.BL, 0),
        // We will load all the categorical features into one vector column of size 8.
        new TextLoader.Column("CategoricalFeatures", DataKind.TX, 1, 8),
        // Similarly, load all numerical features into one vector of size 6.
        new TextLoader.Column("NumericalFeatures", DataKind.R4, 9, 14),
        // Let's also separately load the 'Workclass' column.
        new TextLoader.Column("Workclass", DataKind.TX, 1),
    },
    hasHeader: true
);

// Read the data.
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);

// Inspect the first 10 records of the categorical columns to check that they are correctly read.
var catColumns = data.GetColumn<string[]>(mlContext, "CategoricalFeatures").Take(10).ToArray();

// Build several alternative featurization pipelines.
var pipeline =
    // Convert each categorical feature into one-hot encoding independently.
    mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding("CategoricalOneHot", "CategoricalFeatures")
    // Convert all categorical features into indices, and build a 'word bag' of these.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding("CategoricalBag", "CategoricalFeatures", CategoricalTransform.OutputKind.Bag))
    // One-hot encode the workclass column, then drop all the categories that have fewer than 10 instances in the train set.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding("WorkclassOneHot", "Workclass"))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.FeatureSelection.CountFeatureSelectingEstimator("WorkclassOneHot", "WorkclassOneHotTrimmed", count: 10));

// Let's train our pipeline, and then apply it to the same data.
var transformedData = pipeline.Fit(data).Transform(data);

// Inspect some columns of the resulting dataset.
var categoricalBags = transformedData.GetColumn<float[]>(mlContext, "CategoricalBag").Take(10).ToArray();
var workclasses = transformedData.GetColumn<float[]>(mlContext, "WorkclassOneHotTrimmed").Take(10).ToArray();

// Of course, if we want to train the model, we will need to compose a single float vector of all the features.
// Here's how we could do this:

var fullLearningPipeline = pipeline
    // Concatenate two of the 3 categorical pipelines, and the numeric features.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "NumericalFeatures", "CategoricalBag", "WorkclassOneHotTrimmed"))
    // Cache data in memory so that the following trainer will be able to access training examples without
    // reading them from disk multiple times.
    .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)
    // Now we're ready to train. We chose our FastTree trainer for this classification task.
    .Append(mlContext.BinaryClassification.Trainers.FastTree(numTrees: 50));

// Train the model.
var model = fullLearningPipeline.Fit(data);
```

## How do I train my model on textual data?

Generally speaking, *all ML.NET learners expect the features as a float vector*. So, if some of your data is not natively a float, you will need to convert to floats. 

If we want to learn on textual data, we need to 'extract features' out of the texts. There is an entire research area of NLP (Natural Language Processing) that handles this. In ML.NET we offer some basic mechanisms of text feature extraction:
- Text normalization (removing punctuation, diacritics, switching to lowercase etc.)
- Separator-based tokenization.
- Stopword removal.
- Ngram and skip-gram extraction.
- TF-IDF rescaling.
- Bag of words conversion.

ML.NET offers a "one-stop shop" operation called `TextFeaturizer`, that runs a combination of above steps as one big 'text featurization'. We have tested it extensively on text datasets, and we're confident that it performs reasonably well without the need to deep-dive into the operations. 

However, we also offer a selection of elementary operations that let you customize your NLP processing. Here's the example below where we use them.

Wikipedia detox dataset:
```

    {
        new TextLoader.Column("IsToxic", DataKind.BL, 0),
        new TextLoader.Column("Message", DataKind.TX, 1),
    },
    hasHeader: true
);

// Read the data.
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);

// Inspect the message texts that are read from the file.
var messageTexts = data.GetColumn<string>(mlContext, "Message").Take(20).ToArray();

// Apply various kinds of text operations supported by ML.NET.
var pipeline =
    // One-stop shop to run the full text featurization.
    mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText("TextFeatures", "Message")

    // Normalize the message for later transforms
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.NormalizeText("NormalizedMessage", "Message"))

    // NLP pipeline 1: bag of words.
    .Append(new WordBagEstimator(mlContext, "BagOfWords", "NormalizedMessage"))

    // NLP pipeline 2: bag of bigrams, using hashes instead of dictionary indices.
    .Append(new WordHashBagEstimator(mlContext, "BagOfBigrams","NormalizedMessage", 
                ngramLength: 2, allLengths: false))

    // NLP pipeline 3: bag of tri-character sequences with TF-IDF weighting.

    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.ExtractWordEmbeddings("Embeddings", "TokenizedMessage",
                WordEmbeddingsExtractingEstimator.PretrainedModelKind.GloVeTwitter25D));

// Let's train our pipeline, and then apply it to the same data.
// Note that even on a small dataset of 70KB the pipeline above can take up to a minute to completely train.
var transformedData = pipeline.Fit(data).Transform(data);

// Inspect some columns of the resulting dataset.
var embeddings = transformedData.GetColumn<float[]>(mlContext, "Embeddings").Take(10).ToArray();
var unigrams = transformedData.GetColumn<float[]>(mlContext, "BagOfWords").Take(10).ToArray();
```
## How do I train using cross-validation?

[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) is a useful technique for ML applications. It helps estimate the variance of the model quality from one run to another and also eliminates the need to extract a separate test set for evaluation.

There are a couple pitfalls that await us when we implement our own cross-validation. Essentially, if we are not careful, we may introduce label leakage in the process, so our metrics could become over-inflated.

- It is tempting to apply the same pre-processing to the entire data, and then just cross-validate the final training of the model. If we do this for data-dependent, 'trainable' pre-processing (like text featurization, categorical handling and normalization/rescaling), we cause these processing steps to 'train' on the union of train subset and test subset, thus causing label leakage. The correct way is to apply pre-processing independently for each 'fold' of the cross-validation.
- In many cases there is a natural 'grouping' of the data that needs to be respected. For example, if we are solving a click prediction problem, it's a good idea to group all examples pertaining to one URL to appear in one-fold of the data. If they end up separated, we can introduce label leakage.

ML.NET guards us against both these pitfalls: it will automatically apply the featurization correctly (as long as all of the preprocessing resides in one learning pipeline), and we can use the 'stratification column' concept to make sure that related examples don't get separated.

Here's an example of training on Iris dataset using randomized 90/10 train-test split, as well as a 5-fold cross-validation:
```csharp
// Step one: read the data as an IDataView.
var data = mlContext.Data.ReadFromTextFile<IrisInput>(dataPath,
    // Default separator is tab, but the dataset has comma.
    separatorChar: ','
);

// Build the training pipeline.
var pipeline =
    // Concatenate all the features together into one column 'Features'.
    mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "SepalLength", "SepalWidth", "PetalLength", "PetalWidth")
    // Note that the label is text, so it needs to be converted to key.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Conversions.MapValueToKey("Label"), TransformerScope.TrainTest)
    // Cache data in memory so that SDCA trainer will be able to randomly access training examples without
    // reading data from disk multiple times. Data will be cached at its first use in any downstream step.
    // Notice that unused part in the data may not be cached.
    .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)
    // Use the multi-class SDCA model to predict the label using features.
    .Append(mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.StochasticDualCoordinateAscent());

// Split the data 90:10 into train and test sets, train and evaluate.
var split = mlContext.MulticlassClassification.TrainTestSplit(data, testFraction: 0.1);

// Train the model.
var model = pipeline.Fit(split.TrainSet);
// Compute quality metrics on the test set.
var metrics = mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Evaluate(model.Transform(split.TestSet));
Console.WriteLine(metrics.AccuracyMicro);

// Now run the 5-fold cross-validation experiment, using the same pipeline.
var cvResults = mlContext.MulticlassClassification.CrossValidate(data, pipeline, numFolds: 5);

// The results object is an array of 5 elements. For each of the 5 folds, we have metrics, model and scored test data.
// Let's compute the average micro-accuracy.
var microAccuracies = cvResults.Select(r => r.Metrics.AccuracyMicro);
Console.WriteLine(microAccuracies.Average());

```
## Can I mix and match static and dynamic pipelines?

Yes, we can have both of them in our codebase. The static pipelines are just a statically-typed way to build dynamic pipelines.

Namely, any statically typed component (`DataView<T>`, `Transformer<T>`, `Estimator<T>`) has its dynamic counterpart as an `AsDynamic` property.

Transitioning from dynamic to static types is more costly: we have to formally declare what is the 'schema shape'. Or, in case of estimators and transformers, what is the input and output schema shape. 

We can do this via `AssertStatic<T>` extensions, as demonstrated in the following example, where we mix and match static and dynamic pipelines.
```csharp
// Read the data as an IDataView.
// First, we define the reader: specify the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextReader(ctx => (
        // The four features of the Iris dataset.
        SepalLength: ctx.LoadFloat(0),
        SepalWidth: ctx.LoadFloat(1),
        PetalLength: ctx.LoadFloat(2),
        PetalWidth: ctx.LoadFloat(3),
        // Label: kind of iris.
        Label: ctx.LoadText(4)
    ),
    // Default separator is tab, but the dataset has comma.
    separatorChar: ',');

// Read the data.
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);

// Build the pre-processing pipeline.
var learningPipeline = reader.MakeNewEstimator()
    .Append(r => (
        // Convert string label to a key.
        Label: r.Label.ToKey(),
        // Concatenate all the features together into one column 'Features'.
        Features: r.SepalLength.ConcatWith(r.SepalWidth, r.PetalLength, r.PetalWidth)));

// Now, at the time of writing, there is no static pipeline for OVA (one-versus-all). So, let's
// append the OVA learner to the pipeline.
IEstimator<ITransformer> dynamicPipe = learningPipeline.AsDynamic;

// Create a binary classification trainer.
var binaryTrainer = mlContext.BinaryClassification.Trainers.AveragedPerceptron("Label", "Features");

// Append the OVA learner to the pipeline.
dynamicPipe = dynamicPipe.Append(mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.OneVersusAll(binaryTrainer));

// At this point, we have a choice. We could continue working with the dynamically-typed pipeline, and
// ultimately call dynamicPipe.Fit(data.AsDynamic) to get the model, or we could go back into the static world.
// Here's how we go back to the static pipeline:
var staticFinalPipe = dynamicPipe.AssertStatic(mlContext,
        // Declare the shape of the input. As you can see, it's identical to the shape of the reader:
        // four float features and a string label.
        c => (
            SepalLength: c.R4.Scalar,
            SepalWidth: c.R4.Scalar,
            PetalLength: c.R4.Scalar,
            PetalWidth: c.R4.Scalar,
            Label: c.Text.Scalar),
        // Declare the shape of the output (or a relevant subset of it).
        // In our case, we care only about the predicted label column (a key type), and scores (vector of floats).
        c => (
            Score: c.R4.Vector,
            // Predicted label is a key backed by uint, with text values (since original labels are text).
            PredictedLabel: c.KeyU4.TextValues.Scalar))
    // Convert the predicted label from key back to the original string value.
    .Append(r => r.PredictedLabel.ToValue());

// Train the model in a statically typed way.
var model = staticFinalPipe.Fit(data);

// And here is how we could've stayed in the dynamic pipeline and train that way.
dynamicPipe = dynamicPipe.Append(new KeyToValueEstimator(mlContext, "PredictedLabel"));
var dynamicModel = dynamicPipe.Fit(data.AsDynamic);

// Now 'dynamicModel', and 'model.AsDynamic' are equivalent.
```

## How can I define my own transformation of data?

ML.NET has quite a lot of built-in transformers, but we can not possibly cover everything. Inevitably, you will need to perform custom user-defined operations.
We added `MLContext.Transforms.CustomMapping` for this very purpose: it is a user-defined arbitrary *mapping* of the data.

Suppose that we have the dataset with float 'Income' column, and we want to compute 'Label', that is equal to `true` if the income is more than 50000, and `false` otherwise.

Here's how we can do this via a custom transformer:

```csharp
// Define a class for all the input columns that we intend to consume.
class InputRow
{
    public float Income { get; set; }
}

// Define a class for all output columns that we intend to produce.
class OutputRow
{
    public bool Label { get; set; }
}

public static IDataView PrepareData(MLContext mlContext, IDataView data)
{
    // Define the operation code.
    Action<InputRow, OutputRow> mapping = (input, output) => output.Label = input.Income > 50000;
    // Make a custom transformer and transform the data.
    var transformer = mlContext.Transforms.CustomMappingTransformer(mapping, null);
    return transformer.Transform(data);
}
```

You can also insert a custom mapping inside an estimator pipeline:
```csharp
public static ITransformer TrainModel(MLContext mlContext, IDataView trainData)
{
    // Define the custom operation.
    Action<InputRow, OutputRow> mapping = (input, output) => output.Label = input.Income > 50000;
    // Construct the learning pipeline.
    var estimator = mlContext.Transforms.CustomMapping(mapping, null)
        .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext)
        .Append(mlContext.BinaryClassification.Trainers.FastTree(labelColumnName: "Label"));

    return estimator.Fit(trainData);
}
```

Please note that you need to make your `mapping` operation into a 'pure function':
- It should be reentrant (we will call it simultaneously from multiple threads)
- It should not have side effects (we may call it arbitrarily at any time, or omit the call)

One important caveat is: if you want your custom transformation to be part of your saved model, you will need to provide a `contractName` for it.
At loading time, you will need to register the custom transformer with the MLContext. 

Here is a complete example that saves and loads a model with a custom mapping.
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// One class that contains the custom mapping functionality that we need for our model.
/// 
/// It has a <see cref="CustomMappingFactoryAttributeAttribute"/> on it and
/// derives from <see cref="CustomMappingFactory{TSrc, TDst}"/>.
/// </summary>
[CustomMappingFactoryAttribute(nameof(CustomMappings.IncomeMapping))]
public class CustomMappings : CustomMappingFactory<InputRow, OutputRow>
{
    // This is the custom mapping. We now separate it into a method, so that we can use it both in training and in loading.
    public static void IncomeMapping(InputRow input, OutputRow output) => output.Label = input.Income > 50000;

    // This factory method will be called when loading the model to get the mapping operation.
    public override Action<InputRow, OutputRow> GetMapping()
    {
        return IncomeMapping;
    }
}
```

```csharp
// Construct the learning pipeline. Note that we are now providing a contract name for the custom mapping:
// otherwise we will not be able to save the model.
var estimator = mlContext.Transforms.CustomMapping<InputRow, OutputRow>(CustomMappings.IncomeMapping, nameof(CustomMappings.IncomeMapping))
    .Append(mlContext.BinaryClassification.Trainers.FastTree(labelColumnName: "Label"));

// If memory is enough, we can cache the data in-memory to avoid reading them from file
// when it will be accessed multiple times. 
var cachedTrainData = mlContext.Data.Cache(trainData);

// Train the model.
var model = estimator.Fit(cachedTrainData);

// Save the model.
using (var fs = File.Create(modelPath))
    mlContext.Model.Save(model, fs);

// Now pretend we are in a different process.

// Register the assembly that contains 'CustomMappings' with the ComponentCatalog
// so it can be found when loading the model.
newContext.ComponentCatalog.RegisterAssembly(typeof(CustomMappings).Assembly);

// Now we can load the model.
ITransformer loadedModel;
using (var fs = File.OpenRead(modelPath))
    loadedModel = newContext.Model.Load(fs);
```

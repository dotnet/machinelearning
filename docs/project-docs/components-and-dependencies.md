ML.NET is a modular set of libraries that enables building a pipeline from data loaders, trainers/estimators (in case of training), transformers (in case of inferencing), and various data structures to facilitate the building of pipelines and representing data.  The core of ML.NET â€“ the Microsoft.ML package has no external dependencies. It's largely managed code.  

Microsoft.ML does have a helper native math library CPUMath - which is only used on .NETFramework. .NET 6.0 and later have a managed implementation using intrinsics/TensorPrimitives and do not require the native build of CPUMath.

Microsoft.ML contains one other native library, LDANative, which is used by the LatentDirichletAllocationEstimator/Transform to support the LightLDA algorithm.  If this component is used it will require the LightLDA native library.  The native library is built for linux-arm, linux-arm64, linux-x64, osx-arm64 (M1), osx-x64, win-arm64, win-x64, win-x86.  This library has only platform/CRT dependencies.

Some components that represent an algorithm or binding to another framework are factored into separate packages to allow opt-in to using those and their dependencies.

ML.NET redistributes Intel MKL as Microsoft.ML.MKL.Redist in which is a minimized MKL library linked with just exports needed by ML.NET.  This component follows the support matrix of Intel MKL and is only supported on x86 and x64 architectures: linux-x64, osx-x64 (no longer supported by Intel), win-x64, and win-x86.  Similarly some components have light-up to use an Intel OneDAL implementation which is only supported on x64.

Automatically adding a MinMax normalization transform, use 'norm=Warn' or 'norm=No' to turn this behavior off.
Warning: Skipped 16 instances with missing features/label/weight during training
Beginning optimization
num vars: 10
improvement criterion: Mean Improvement
L1 regularization selected 10 of 10 weights.
Not training a calibrator because it is not needed.
Warning: The predictor produced non-finite prediction values on 16 instances during testing. Possible causes: abnormal data or the predictor is numerically unstable.

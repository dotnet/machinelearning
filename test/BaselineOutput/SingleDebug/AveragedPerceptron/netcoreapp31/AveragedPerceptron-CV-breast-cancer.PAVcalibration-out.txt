Automatically adding a MinMax normalization transform, use 'norm=Warn' or 'norm=No' to turn this behavior off.
Warning: Skipped 8 instances with missing features during training (over 1 iterations; 8 inst/iter)
Training calibrator.
PAV calibrator:  piecewise function approximation has 6 components.

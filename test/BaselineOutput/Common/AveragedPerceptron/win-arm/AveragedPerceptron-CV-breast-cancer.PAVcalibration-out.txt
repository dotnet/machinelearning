Automatically adding a MinMax normalization transform, use 'norm=Warn' or 'norm=No' to turn this behavior off.
Warning: Skipped 80 instances with missing features during training (over 10 iterations; 8 inst/iter)
Training calibrator.
PAV calibrator:  piecewise function approximation has 5 components.

Training calibrator.
PAV calibrator:  piecewise function approximation has 6 components.
Warning: The predictor produced non-finite prediction values on 8 instances during testing. Possible causes: abnormal data or the predictor is numerically unstable.

The number of instances used for stacking trainer is 213
Warning: The trainer specified for stacking wants normalization, but we do not currently allow this.
Warning: Skipped 4 instances with missing features during training (over 1 iterations; 4 inst/iter)
Training calibrator.
Warning: The predictor produced non-finite prediction values on 16 instances during testing. Possible causes: abnormal data or the predictor is numerically unstable.

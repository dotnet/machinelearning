num vars: 7
improvement criterion: Mean Improvement
L1 regularization selected 7 of 7 weights.
Model trained with 500 training examples.
Residual Deviance: 	458.9709 (on 493 degrees of freedom)
Null Deviance:     	539.2764 (on 499 degrees of freedom)
AIC:               	472.9709
Warning: The number of parameters is too large. Cannot hold the variance-covariance matrix in memory. Skipping computation of standard errors and z-statistics of coefficients. Consider choosing a larger L1 regularizerto reduce the number of parameters.
Not training a calibrator because it is not needed.

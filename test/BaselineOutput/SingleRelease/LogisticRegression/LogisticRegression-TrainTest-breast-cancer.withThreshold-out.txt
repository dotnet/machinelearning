improvement criterion: Mean Improvement
L1 regularization selected 10 of 10 weights.
Not training a calibrator because it is not needed.
Warning: The predictor produced non-finite prediction values on 16 instances during testing. Possible causes: abnormal data or the predictor is numerically unstable.

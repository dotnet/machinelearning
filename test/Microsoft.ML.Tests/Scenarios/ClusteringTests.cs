America's pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history, revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: ""A well regulated militia,
                being necessary to the security of a free State,
                the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
                shall not be infringed.""

Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that gun violence would be reduced; that gun restrictions have always existed; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions. " });

Perhaps you may buy your dog a favorite toy or stop by the dog bakery to order some great tasting doggy cookies, or perhaps you just love patting your dog in the evening in the way he most loves. But how do our dogs tell us they love us too?

Until the day your dog can talk, you'll never likely hear him pronounce ""I love you,"" and in the meantime, don't expect him to purchase you a Hallmark card or some balloons with those renowned romantic words printed on top. Also, don’t expect a box of chocolates or a bouquet of flowers from your dog when Valentine's day is around the corner. Sometimes it might feel like we're living an uneven relationship, but just because dogs don't communicate their love the way we do, doesn't mean they don't love us!"

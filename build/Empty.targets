      In the SDK ImportAfter folder, this property is declared to point to Microsoft.TestPlatform.targets, which is the file containing the original VSTest target.
      Since the Microsoft.TestPlatform.targets are in the ImportAfter folder, they would be imported after this file hence our empty VSTest target would be overriden,
      in order to be able to override this target, we set the VSTestTargets property to an inexistent file path, so nothing will be imported and that way we successfully
      overrode the VSTest target.

    Import this file to suppress all targets while allowing the project to participate in the build. 
    Workaround for https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/2071. 

    The targets defined here are not sufficient for the project to be open in Visual Studio without issues though.

0	" A tag has been placed on Jerome leung kam, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.   If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.  For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   "

0	"  == Administrator Complaint Filed Against You ==  I requested that you do not edit the article until the editor assistance has been sought. But you still added and the tag you added is fault because this is a professionally written article, besides the last section there is nothing about the article having a fan flavor to it. Before you add the add again please do show which section besides the ""What Ram's Fan's have to say about him"" seems written from a fan point of view. This article besides the last section adheres to the Wikpedia standard of writing. IF not please first prove it in my notes. As for the resource the technical person on the team is in the process of adding the refernce link to the source after which we will remove that tag as well.   Once again please do not add false tags, lets wait for the editor and the administrator, I did tell the administrator to look at the history and have provided your notes to him. So at this time, just have patience and lets wait.  I am  also forwarding this to the administrator from whom I have requested help. Like I said before, as adminstrator came to the page and made the necessary changes, she did not find the article sub-standard, so please refrain from adding tags.    "

0	  :Hello Cielomobile. I have to say that I also belive that the edits made recently to the United States-Mexico barrier page were not vandalism. I understand that the topic of the border can be polemic, but I don't think that User:68.2.242.165 was vandalizing the page. Maybe you could use the talk page Talk:United States–Mexico barrier to lay out your objections to those edits without deleting them entirely. I think they were good-faith efforts to improve the article, and that is also one of the guiding principles of Wikipedia, to Assume Good Faith. It might help though, if the author of those edits were to register with Wikipedia so the edits won't appear merely with an IP address.  
0	"  == my removal of your content on DNA melting ==  I removed the content you placed when creating the article because it was wrong and unreferenced. Mutations do not have ""weird structures""  a point mutation might start with a single nucleotide mismatch, but those are rapidly detected and repaired to form a stable bonded double-helix structure, and subsequent rounds of DNA replication match each base with its complement. Perhaps your wording was wrong, perhaps you were thinking of an obscure related technology that I have heard of, but you didn't give a reference and I'm not going to help you with this, because you're being rude. I find it disturbing that you apparently made this scientific page on wikipedia claiming a statement of fact that was in merely based on your own speculations.  "

0	"  ::I also found use of the word ""humanists"" confusing.  The types of people listed preceding ""humanists"" are defined by what they *do* (i.e. study, teach, do medical research) which makes sense in the context of talking about the commonplace book as one of their tools.  ""Humanists"" defines people of a certain ethical ideologywhat does that have to do with the function of a commonplace book?  Is the use of a commonplace book particularly defined by one's world perspective?  To me this would be akin to writing ""many blogs are maintained by writers, professors, lawyers, editorialists, and Republicans/Democrats"" in an article about blogs.  True though it may be, it confuses the reader into thinking that the subject being written about is somehow ideologically specific when it is not."

As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts."

0	"==  Inclusion of school type, gender, and religious information for HNMCS ==  There have been repeated deletions by Mikeycanuck (aka 99.254.17.230) which remove pertinent information about Holy Name of Mary College School (HNMCS) from this article. The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, ""The Felician Sisters and St. Michael's College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School"". As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.    I don't agree that it is relevant information to give these details about Holy Name on the SMCS wiki. People reading the SMCS page quickly learn that Holy Name of Mary is the official sister school, and that it must be an all-girls school. That Holy Name is Catholic or private is also irrelavant in the SMCS article. If a reader interested in information on Holy Name wants to learn about it, he/she can go to the Holy Name wiki. I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike's info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by      The point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael's College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article.     They are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools' connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school's wiki for more detailed information and don't need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  ""Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About    So if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view?     I only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), ""Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM's wiki.""  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph.     The detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school's links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its ""sister school"" for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.     I never

1	  Pss Rex, be sure to DOCUMENT all the things you've discovered  on the John Kerry page etc.  It's awesome that you and I INDEPENDENTLY observed (and can corrorborate) virtually the exactsame  pattern by these liberals. Demonizing conservatives; lionizing liberals. It's repeated ad infinitum, ad nauseum.  The more proof we have, the easier it will be to persuade all but their fellow brain-dead truth haters to give a red cent to Wikipedia. And, until WHOLESALE changes are made from the top down, that's exactly what's about to happen. It's almost like this is the liberal's religion. Too bad they're gonna have to find a church other than Wikipedia to practice their faith, huh?  I've heard rumors that my actions are already sending users Hippocrite, Fred Bauder, WoohooKitty, Kizzle, FVW, Derex and especially the pimply faced 15 year old RedWolf  to become so verklempt they don't know whether to schedule an appointement with their psychiatrist...or their gynecologist.

0	" ::The problem is not only with the sections concerning ""Controversy about media coverage"", the major problem is that many major points about the Greek debt crisis are missing in the lead and the article, even though it consists of >100 pages. This is addressed in  ::* section #4 - "">100 pages, but still main points missing?"" ::* section #5 - "" Why did Greece need fiscal austerity in the midst of its crisis? "" ::* section #6 -  "" POV / LEAD debate "" ::Two weeks ago, I proposed in this section #4 to have the main points at least in summary style in the lead (as important ones are not even in the article) ::Just let's only take the first point listed in #4, being joining the Euro without sufficient financial convergence and competitiveness in the summary list of causes for the Greek debt crisis. It is the major single and early root cause for the Greek debt crisis. Without this root cause Greece could technically not have had this debt crisis because it could always have printed itself out of every debt volume as they did before with the drachma. But this cause is missing in the 100 WP pages and in the WP lead. The current lead only lists normal problems like ""structural weaknesses"" and ""recessions""  (even though it is clear that Greece faced those normal problems for decades and always solved them with high drachma inflation if needed) - so without naming the root cause there is no cause for the Greek debt crisis. ::What happened after I proposed to have the main points in the article (at least in the lead as a summary) and also invited everybody to add/change/delete from my proposed the main point list? There were strong opponents working in a coordinated action, threatening to fight any significant change, saying one can not summarize a Greek debt crisis, saying ""Greek interests [need to have] a prominence"") when describing the debt crisis in WP, saying they will not let other editors summarize it, and so on. So we have almost 100 new pages in the talk section, and main points about the lemma not in the article (like it was during the last 5 years) ::  "

Some of the sentences there seem copied directly from Dr Gerstenfeld’s homepage; this is not desirable, because it creates the impression that the article was copied from the homepage, which might be be a copyright violation. Perhaps you should try to rewrite the article a bit to avoid that. Also, some kind of indication about why Dr Gerstenfeld is notable would be nice to have (cf.

I still use Wikipedia a lot but have no interest whatsoever in editing it ever again, so by all means say that I was blocked for disruptive editing (guilty: I got fed up with the lot of you) or whatever else I was accused of before this puppeteer nonsense was settled on (the crime kept changing) but I'm not happy with what you currently show.

0	"  ::Thanks for the reply – my biggest issue at the moment is whether to include ""sales figures"" for earlier years... as far as I know, there were no published end of year sales figures before 1994, and the sales published at the time for 1994 to 1996 have since been discredited and revised, so are basically worthless. The figures currently quoted in the articles up to 1996 are usually ""estimates"" that have been taken from various charts message boards, calculated by enthusiasts from officially published yearly sales figures per artist (i.e. sales could be made up of one or more singles or albums, and estimating what percentage of sales were assigned to each record). As these are completely unofficial and unverifiable, I am thinking to remove them altogether or at least add a note that all figures are unofficial and estimated. In any case I don't think most people are interested in how many records the 37th best selling album of 1987 sold that year – it makes more sense to me to concentrate efforts into keeping List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom up to date.

0	"  :So I will start with a criticism of the quote from Ollier and Pain, with whom I have more general issues than the ""postorogenic part"". Phrase by phrase that I disagree with: :# Only much later was it realized that the two processes [deformation and the creation of topography] were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. Very wrong. Deformation causes topography, and the generation of topography is synchronous with deformation. I will email you a copy of Dahlen and Suppe (1988), which shows that this is the case - send me a message so I have your address and can attach a PDF. They tackle the large-scale deformation of sedimentary rocks via folding and thrusting during orogenesis. :# ...fold-belt mountainous areas...: ""fold-belt"" isn't used professionally (AFAIK) to refer to a collisional mountain-building event. A minor thing though. :# Only in the very youngest, late Cenozoic mountains is there any evident causal relation between rock structure and surface landscape. and the following sentence: If I were British, I would call this ""utter twaddle"". As I mentioned above, there is no way for many of the exposed structures to get to the surface without large amounts of rock uplift and erosion. And as a matter of fact, the trajectory of different units of rock through an orogen is in part determined by patterns of surface erosion. To keep it simple and send you one paper, you'll find this in and at the end of the paper by Dahlen and Suppe (1988). :  "

1	So, in other words, you are professionally on the dole. You must live in your parents basement and leech off of them, like a 11-year old. Maybe if you had a bit of motivation, you could look for a real job, and not play your fantasy as a Wiki boy. I'm sure you couls start a career as a video game player.

1	I doubt this will get through your thick head (it's not an insult, it's an opinion based on your response) but the problem is not the issue itself. It's that people like you seem to enjoy (whether or not your side gets it right) to discuss, turn, twist and frankly abuse topics like this which are detrimental to the basic goals of Wikis in general and Wikipedia in particular. As John Stewart said to two hacks; You're hurting us.

0	  It's those biography and political articles you should watch out for.
1	  FURTHERMORE.... I HAVE JUST VISITED RAGIB'S PAGE AND STUDIED THE DISCUSSION AREA. RAGIB IS OBVIOUSLY FROM BANGLADESH AND SEEMS TO BE A SIMILARLY PAROCHIAL CHAUVINIST EDITOR OF MANY OTHER ARTICLES, EVEN ASKING FOR UN-NECESSARY DELETIONS OF ARTICLES THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE..... AND GETTING SNUBBED FOR THE EFFORT!!
1	I beg your pardon? I am from the region, and berbers are a minority. How dare you presume to know people's origins? you can live in your make-belief world, but do not post it as fact and don't delete my posts either to further veil the truth. I am contacting Wikipedia immediately concerning this largely fictitious, vicious article and discussion.

0	"  == Need your help in an article ==  Hi Kansas bear, I need your help in an article called ""Sultanate of Rum"", vandalized by Turkish nationalist and even including dubious sources from books like lonelyplanet travel guides. The guy has a profound anti neutrality agenda, even removing the Persianate description of the state and changing a section about Sultanate's architecture, by renaming it as ""culture"", in order to move around the sources for the Persianate terms. I think it needs to be addressed by more than one person to kick out the nationalistic bias from the article.  "
1	This is pure tripe stolen from their bio on their official website, which is outdated by the way. That's bad wiki practice.
0	I saw it before watching the episode. Oh well.
1	  Stupid! You're the one who stops for massive and undiscussed removal on the article. Also, you say you're interest in Chinese history well then go for it and don't ever pay attention to Vietnamese history.   
0	"Jackson didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on ""We've Had Enough"" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support all his siblings and parents. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, ""Dangerous"", and it was thoroughly mediocre music. Almost all of Jackson's remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - a meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album weren't good, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, but the less said about that the better. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire the disgraced former King of Pop. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's active career finished a decade ago. ( )  "

29338	area-System.Net	Include fragment and query in Uri.LocalPath on Unix	While testing XmlUriResolver, @pjanotti discovered that any segments of a file path following a '#' symbol will be cut out of Uri.LocalPath on Unix. Based on additional tests, this also occurs for the '?' symbol. This is happening because the Unix specific case for local path only uses the path component of the URI:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/9e8d443ff78c4f0a9a6bedf7f95961cf96ceff0a/src/System.Private.Uri/src/System/Uri.cs#L1032-L1037    The fix here is to include the fragment and query in LocalPath in the Unix path specific case. This PR enables the test case in XmlUriResolver that uncovered this issues, and adds some additional cases to our URI tests.    Fixes: #28486 
29337	area-System.Net	Unify setting null CookieContainer behavior on HttpClientHandler	For HttpClientHandler layer (above the WinHttpHandler layer on Windows), we should be consistent and throw the exception in the CookieContainer setter when null value is provided, to match .NET Framework's behavior.  This would keep the same behavior across all platforms for the setter of the HttpClientHandler.CookieContainer property.    Close: #3205
29334	area-System.Net	Check URI scheme length only after verifying the scheme contains valid characters	"URI construction is failing on valid URIs under the following conditions:  - An absolute URI is constructed using the `Uri(Uri absolute, string relative)` constructor.  - The relative string begins with 1024+ characters, followed by a colon.  - The relative string contains but does not begin with a forward or back slash.    See the test added in this PR for an example URI.    The fix is to check the scheme length _after_ validating that the potential scheme contains only legal characters (ie, not a forward or back slash). This keeps us from running into the situation above, where the relative URI contains a colon that is unambiguously not a scheme separator because the ""scheme"" is actually just a path that contains a colon.    This fix improves the correctness of our relative path parsing at the cost of an additional stacalloc in the case where the relative part of the URI is really an absolute URI with a scheme length >= 1024.    Fixes: #29011     Details below:  ---------  When we construct an absolute URI from a relative URI, the first thing we try to do is parse the relative URI as an absolute URI. That parsing process returns an error code that we use to determine what happens next. The parsing errors are as follows:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/bffef76f6af208e2042a2f27bc081ee908bb390b/src/System.Private.Uri/src/System/UriEnumTypes.cs#L67-L93    If we successfully parse an absolute URI (error = None), we return that URI and ignore the absolute URI we were passed.   That might seem a little odd, but it's a useful behavior in practice.    If we get an error that is less than `LastRelativeUriOkErrIndex`(see the code above), we attempt to create a relative URI from the string and then root it with the absolute URI provided.    If we return any other error, we believe that the string is neither a valid relative or absolute URI and throw an exception. In this case, PrivateParseMinimal is returning the error `SchemeLimit`, which indicates that we have too large of a scheme. As documented in the code above, this isn't considered a recoverable error.    The relative string provided has some characters that are clearly invalid in a scheme, so the real error we should be returning from TryParse is `InvalidScheme`. Since `InvalidScheme` is less than `LastRelativeUriOkErrIndex`, we will then be able to create a relative URI. Fixing the returned parsing error allows this URI to be constructed successfully."

29327	area-System.Security	Enable EnvelopedCms to work with an external private key	There are two scenarios that are not currently possible with the EnvelopedCms class.    1) Decrypting the contents of an EnvelopedCms with an unattached/unattachable key (a la RSAKeyVault).  2) Being able to prove which certificate+key were used for the decryption operation, because the existing members all dive into the CurrentUser\My certificate store looking for other candidate certs+keys.  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49815448/can-envelopedcms-be-used-to-identify-the-encryption-certificate)    The strawman suggestion is a new Decrypt overload which does not initiate a store search, and happens to allow specifying a private key.    ```diff  public partial class EnvelopedCms  {  +    public void Decrypt(X509Certificate2 certificate, AsymmetricAlgorithm privateKey) => throw null;  }  ```    Maybe it also makes sense for the RecipientInfo overload.    Verifying the private key really belongs to the public key is a little trickier.  Maybe it's not important for Decrypt, since the certificate finds the matching recipient key info and the private key turns that back into the symmetric key... it either works or it doesn't.    Maybe this would be `TryDecrypt`, and returns false if the cert matches no recipients?

29323	area-System.IO	MacOS - Special hidden folders	Dear corefx team,  We have encountered a special case of hidden folders in MacOs based machines.    When using DirectoryInfo to map the users machine, we are interested in knowing which folders are hidden, therefore checking the `FileAttributes.Hidden` attribute, which is determined if the file\directory name starts with a dot - '.'  Sadly, we found out that in MacOS uses additional file system flags to mark folders as - **hidden**.    We can check it by using the Terminal, or iTerm in my case and navigating to the home folder of a user and using `ls -l` to output the file dir.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32832019/39242329-5a3d57e2-4892-11e8-9bc8-ff8420d9090d.png)    as we can see there are no UNIX hidden folders which starts with a dot.  But `Library` is a hidden folder.  If we would pass the `O` flag to show file flags (-O is a flag only in MacOS)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32832019/39242842-2db4ced8-4894-11e8-8f83-d4d867522b45.png)    As we can see there are additional flags that mark a folder as hidden.  to set or unset the flag we use `chflags` with the `hidden` or `nohidden` arguments.    .NET Core info  ```  .NET Command Line Tools (2.0.0)    Product Information:   Version:            2.0.0   Commit SHA-1 hash:  cdcd1928c9    Runtime Environment:   OS Name:     Mac OS X   OS Version:  10.13   OS Platform: Darwin   RID:         osx.10.12-x64   Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.0.0/    Microsoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host      Version  : 2.0.0    Build    : e8b8861ac7faf042c87a5c2f9f2d04c98b69f28d  ```    Is there anything we can do to workaround this?  I've poked around corefx + coreclr and saw that the DirectoryEntry struct only uses iNodeType to determine multiple attributes.  Is there a plan to support flags in the future?    Thank you very much,  Hagai.

29301	area-System.Runtime	Optionally disabling AggregateException from showing other Exception messages in its own Message?	I've noticed that `AggregateException`'s `Message` property always shows the messages of the exceptions within it in parentheses after the `AggregateException`'s own `Message`.  Is there any chance that a change will be made to allow the customisation of this behaviour, such as setting whether to display the `Message` of the `AggregateException` only without the messages of its `InnerExceptions`?    I've read that this was changed a while back to make `AggregateException` messages more descriptive, but sometimes I want to have the `Message` of an `AggregateException` remain as I entered it.

29290	area-System.IO	Add UTF-8 match algorithm for FileSystemName?	A UTF-8 implementation of [`FileSystemName.MatchesSimpleExpression`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.IO.FileSystem/src/System/IO/Enumeration/FileSystemName.cs#L95) would allow matching Unix/Mac data without having to first convert to UTF-16. Something like this perhaps:    ``` C#  namespace System.IO.Enumeration  {      // name is UTF-8      public static bool MatchesSimpleExpression(ReadOnlySpan<char> expression, ReadOnlySpan<byte> name, bool ignoreCase = true)  }  ```    This could potentially improve performance. We currently convert from UTF-8 into a temporary UTF-16 buffer on the stack- it may also be that improvements here don't register against the cost of I/O. https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.IO.FileSystem/src/System/IO/Enumeration/FileSystemEntry.Unix.cs#L88-L103    If anyone has a particular interest in this they are welcome to try and implement. If we find there is, in fact, a measurable benefit we can look at making a formal API proposal at that point.

Some of the functions, typically set or related may actually have no chance of returning error assuming we pass good parameters.  
29286	area-System.Net	Always use DnsEndPoint in SocketHttpHandler's ConnectAsync	We had a minor optimization here, but there's a long-standing issue with Socket.ConnectAsync where it's leaving for finalization a socket when the connect with an IP address fails.  It's more important to address that issue, and using DnsEndPoint does so (it's also the code we want, anyway).    Contributes to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26517  Contributes to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29285    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh 
29285	area-System.Net	Socket.ConnectAsync with an IPAddress and a failed connection leaves a Socket for finalization	"The static Socket.ConnectAsync method creates one or more Sockets to use to establish the connection, and that Socket is then returned when the connection is made successfully.  When the connection fails, it's supposed to Dispose of the created Socket(s).  But it's failing to do so when something other than a DnsEndPoint is supplied, hitting this code path:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/4fc38265fb35fd6bfc982b8e35a2545502e596b3/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/Socket.cs#L3975-L3976  that creates the Socket but then uses the public `ConnectAsync(SocketAsyncEventArgs)`, which can't Dispose of the Socket because it doesn't know that it's one internally created (since it's a public method and the caller owns the Socket instance).  This ends up leaking a socket handle / file descriptor until the Socket / SafeHandle's finalizer runs to close it, eventually.    This issue exists in both .NET Core and .NET Framework, and appears to have existed for a long time.  However, it's showing up as an issue for SocketsHttpHandler, due to this optimization:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/4fc38265fb35fd6bfc982b8e35a2545502e596b3/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/SocketsHttpHandler/ConnectHelper.cs#L57-L59  where SocketsHttpHandler is trying to take the more optimized IPEndPoint path when an IP address is supplied.  This then means that HttpClient failed connects end up leaking a handle / file descriptor similarly until the finalizer runs, which if lots of requests are being made, could result in ""too many open files"" errors on Unix.    I'm marking this as a 2.1 issue just for the SocketsHttpHandler fix, as it's a new issue in 2.1.  The Sockets issue should be addressed, but it's long-standing and can be deferred to 2.2."

Stack trace snippet:  ```  Parameter name: name  at System.Security.AccessControl.NativeObjectSecurity.CreateInternal(ResourceType resourceType, Boolean isContainer, String name, SafeHandle handle, AccessControlSections includeSections, Boolean createByName, ExceptionFromErrorCode exceptionFromErrorCode, Object exceptionContext)  at System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemSecurity..ctor(Boolean isContainer, String name, AccessControlSections includeSections, Boolean isDirectory)  at System.Security.AccessControl.FileSecurity..ctor(String fileName, AccessControlSections includeSections)  ```  [Sample code demostrating this](https://gist.github.com/scovetta/01a6bca7881d3772a2b7bcf71cecf6aa)    A workaround for this is to prefix the path with `\\?\`, as shown below:  ```  // Fails  var fs = new FileSecurity(@""c:\temp\really-long-name.txt"", AccessControlSections.All);  // Succeeds  var fs = new FileSecurity(@""\\?\c:\temp\really-long-name.txt"", AccessControlSections.All);  ```    It would be useful if the FileSecurity class (and probably others) could do this on the caller's behalf, or if that could cause breakage, then updating the FileSecurity [documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/blob/master/xml/System.Security.AccessControl/FileSecurity.xml) to describe this (or if there's a better workaround).

29274	area-System.Diagnostics	Add FileLogTraceListener, Log and Asp​Log classes to .Net Core	FileLogTraceListener class is available in .net framework in the Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging namespace. It has some useful features that are not available in other TraceListeners, as descried here:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.logging.filelogtracelistener?view=netframework-4.7.2    This class is not available in .Net Core, so I suggest you add it and make it available to both VB.NET and C#.  And I suggest the same for Log Class  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.logging.log?view=netframework-4.7.2  and Asp​Log Class:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.logging.asplog?view=netframework-4.7.2  
29273	area-System.IO	Add FileSystem.Watcher.FilterList Property	"# Rationale  Currently there is no support for using multiple regex filters to monitor the file system using FileSystemWatcher Class. eg. If we want to monitor files with two extensions (.dll and .pdb), we wont be able to directly to due it.    There are 2 ways to work around this issue but non of them is optimal.    1. Create an instance of fileSystemWatcher class and listen to all the files using ```""*"" ``` filter and then prune the files manually in the event handler.  ```  eg. If (filename.endswith(""*.txt"") || filename.endswith(""*.csv""))     // do   ```    This approach is highly inefficient because first of all we are listening to all files and then user have to manually filter the files which defeats the purpose of having the ```Filter``` in the first place. Here are some links where people asked for this new functionality but has to settle down for this approach    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6965184/how-to-set-filter-for-filesystemwatcher-for-multiple-file-types  https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/91ebc868-2661-4477-b825-5b796d020ab1/how-do-i-setup-filewatcher-filter-for-multiple-document-types?forum=csharpgeneral  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38467389/filter-to-not-include-multiple-extensions    2. The Second approach is two create multiple instances of FileSystemWatcher with different regex filters and hook them to the same event handlers.    # Proposed API  ``` C#  namespace System.IO  {      public class FileSystemWatcher      {          public Collection<string> FilterList { get; set; }      }  }  ```    Currently we use ```string _filter``` as a backing field for ```Filter``` property. I suggest using ```Collection<string> _filterList``` as a backing field for both the ```Filter and FilterList Property```.    Filter property will always return the first element of the list (In Case of multiple Filters too)     # Implementation Branch  https://github.com/Anipik/corefx/tree/Filter  This is the rough implementation of the api and how it will modify the ```constructor and Filter property```.    >what happens when you set Filter?     It just sets the first element and does not reduce the size of collection.     >What happens if you set FilterList to null or empty or clear it or removeall items using removeAt?    In all the above cases, we change it to the collection with just only one element i.e ```*```    >What do we do if an element in Filters is null or empty? If we match everything, can/should we optimize?    We never have a ```null or empty element``` in the collection. We always replace it with ```*``` while adding to the collection  >If we match everything, can/should we optimize?    We can optimise by not going further through the collection of the list if we encounter ```*```.    >What about a constructor overload that takes the filters?    we can use Initializer to initialize the FilterList   ```  var watcher3 = new FileSystemWatcher() { FilterList = new Collection<string> { ""*.pdb"", "".exe"", "".doc"" } };  Assert.Equal(3, watcher3.FilterList.Count);  ```   It will be breaking change as ```FileSystemWatcher(""path"", null)``` will be ambiguous call for ```FileSystemWater(string path, IEnumnerable<string> FilterList)```    # Usage  ``` C#  var watcher = new FileSystemWatcher();  watcher.FilterList[0] = ""*.pdb"";  watcher.FilterList.Add(""*.exe"");  watcher.FilterList.Add(""*.dll"");  Assert.Equal(3, watcher.FilterList.Count);    var watcher2 = new FileSystemWatcher( @""C:\git\corefx"",""*.pdb"");  watcher2.FilterList.Add(""*.exe"");  watcher2.FilterList.Add(""*.dll"");  Assert.Equal(3, watcher2.FilterList.Count);    var watcher3 = new FileSystemWatcher() { FilterList = new Collection<string> { ""*.pdb"", "".exe"", "".doc"" } };  Assert.Equal(3, watcher3.FilterList.Count);    var watcher4 = new FileSystemWatcher() { FilterList = null };  Assert.Equal(1, watcher4.FilterList.Count);    var watcher5 = new FileSystemWatcher() { FilterList = new Collection<string> { null } };  Assert.Equal(""*"", watcher5.Filter);    var watcher6 = new FileSystemWatcher();  watcher6.FilterList = new Collection<string> { ""*.pdb"", "".exe"", "".doc"" };  Assert.Equal(3, watcher6.FilterList.Count);  ```    cc @danmosemsft @JeremyKuhne "

It looks like SystemColors is exposed in different places for 2.0/2.1 and I don't get where things go wrong.    ### NET Core 2.0  ```  SystemColors.ActiveBorder            = Color [AliceBlue]  SystemColors.ActiveCaption           = Color [AntiqueWhite]  SystemColors.ActiveCaptionText       = Color [Aqua]  SystemColors.AppWorkspace            = Color [Aquamarine]  SystemColors.ButtonFace              = Color []  SystemColors.ButtonHighlight         = Color []  SystemColors.ButtonShadow            = Color []  SystemColors.Control                 = Color [Azure]  SystemColors.ControlDark             = Color [Beige]  SystemColors.ControlDarkDark         = Color [Bisque]  SystemColors.ControlLight            = Color [Black]  SystemColors.ControlLightLight       = Color [BlanchedAlmond]  SystemColors.ControlText             = Color [Blue]  SystemColors.Desktop                 = Color [BlueViolet]  SystemColors.GradientActiveCaption   = Color []  SystemColors.GradientInactiveCaption = Color []  SystemColors.GrayText                = Color [Brown]  SystemColors.Highlight               = Color [BurlyWood]  SystemColors.HighlightText           = Color [CadetBlue]  SystemColors.HotTrack                = Color [Chartreuse]  SystemColors.InactiveBorder          = Color [Chocolate]  SystemColors.InactiveCaption         = Color [Coral]  SystemColors.InactiveCaptionText     = Color [CornflowerBlue]  SystemColors.Info                    = Color [Cornsilk]  SystemColors.InfoText                = Color [Crimson]  SystemColors.Menu                    = Color [Cyan]  SystemColors.MenuBar                 = Color []  SystemColors.MenuHighlight           = Color []  SystemColors.MenuText                = Color [DarkBlue]  SystemColors.ScrollBar               = Color [DarkCyan]  SystemColors.Window                  = Color [DarkGoldenrod]  SystemColors.WindowFrame             = Color [DarkGray]  SystemColors.WindowText              = Color [DarkGreen]  ```    ### NET Core 2.1 (Preview)  ```  SystemColors.ActiveBorder            = Color [ActiveBorder]  SystemColors.ActiveCaption           = Color [ActiveCaption]  SystemColors.ActiveCaptionText       = Color [ActiveCaptionText]  SystemColors.AppWorkspace            = Color [AppWorkspace]  SystemColors.ButtonFace              = Color [ButtonFace]  SystemColors.ButtonHighlight         = Color [ButtonHighlight]  SystemColors.ButtonShadow            = Color [ButtonShadow]  SystemColors.Control                 = Color [Control]  SystemColors.ControlDark             = Color [ControlDark]  SystemColors.ControlDarkDark         = Color [ControlDarkDark]  SystemColors.ControlLight            = Color [ControlLight]  SystemColors.ControlLightLight       = Color [ControlLightLight]  SystemColors.ControlText             = Color [ControlText]  SystemColors.Desktop                 = Color [Desktop]  SystemColors.GradientActiveCaption   = Color [GradientActiveCaption]  SystemColors.GradientInactiveCaption = Color [GradientInactiveCaption]  SystemColors.GrayText                = Color [GrayText]  SystemColors.Highlight               = Color [Highlight]  SystemColors.HighlightText           = Color [HighlightText]  SystemColors.HotTrack                = Color [HotTrack]  SystemColors.InactiveBorder          = Color [InactiveBorder]  SystemColors.InactiveCaption         = Color [InactiveCaption]  SystemColors.InactiveCaptionText     = Color [InactiveCaptionText]  SystemColors.Info                    = Color [Info]  SystemColors.InfoText                = Color [InfoText]  SystemColors.Menu                    = Color [Menu]  SystemColors.MenuBar                 = Color [MenuBar]  SystemColors.MenuHighlight           = Color [MenuHighlight]  SystemColors.MenuText                = Color [MenuText]  SystemColors.ScrollBar               = Color [ScrollBar]  SystemColors.Window                  = Color [Window]  SystemColors.WindowFrame             = Color [WindowFrame]  SystemColors.WindowText              = Color [WindowText]  ```
29268	area-Meta	Fix crossfs build for armel jessie	The source list was incorrectly containing stable/main sources in addition  to the jessie/main. That caused the openssl 1.1 to creep in and the  build with such crossfs was failing since we were trying to compile  against ssl 1.1 headers.  The reason why it was working in the past is that the stable branch used  to be something older and so it didn't have this issue.  The stable repo reference most likely came from coreclr where it was   needed to get the lldb-dev package.

29265	area-System.Diagnostics	System.Diagnostics.Activity does not use Correlation-Context: Id in GetRootId	While `Activity` is implementing the hierarchical request id spec, in the case of a mixed hierarchical and non-hierarchical scenario, if the parent service only supports the flat request id, but it sets the `Correlation-Context: Id` header, then that `Id` should have made it into the baggage and would be available to pull from.    I think `Activity.RootId` should also check the baggage keys in addition to the `Id` and `ParentId`.    @lmolkova as an author of the spec and `Activity` implementation.
29264	area-Infrastructure	Build for netfx does not run tests if tests source files was not changed	To run `netfx` tests for `System.Memory` library I use next command `..\..\build . -framework:netfx` in `src\System.Memory ` folder.    If source files for tests are not changed than this command does not start tests. It only build library.  To run tests I should change some source file in `src\System.Memory\tests` folder.    If run `build` command without  `-framework:netfx` option it will run tests always. But I want run tests for `netfx` without touching tests source files.    Can it be fixed?

29258	area-System.Runtime	API Proposal: RuntimeFeature.HasJit	# Rationale  The most efficient patterns for reflection depend on the current runtime. On .NET Core, ```System.Reflection.  Emit``` or LINQ Expressions are usually most efficient because the JIT compiles them at runtime. However, for .NET Native, CoreRT, (and I believe Mono AoT), ```System.Reflection.Emit``` isn't available and LINQ Expressions are interpreted. Mono has progress on an interpreter that could make ```System.Reflection.Emit``` work, but it would still likely be less efficient than using reflection APIs directly. Library developers occasionally ask for a way to find out what will both work and be efficient on the current runtime.     This has come up in #10470 and https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/3079.    # Proposed API  Add ```HasJit``` ~~and ```CanEmitIL```~~ properties to the existing ```System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeFeature``` class:  ```  public class RuntimeFeature  {      public static bool HasJit { get; }  }  ```    ```HasJit``` is true if the current runtime can emit optimized native code at runtime. ~~CanEmitIL is true if System.Reflection.Emit works at all, whether it's implemented by a JIT or an interpreter.~~    # Example Usage  Serializers or dependency injection frameworks often have methods that construct an object with some knowledge of its signature. With this API, it could be optimized to look something like this:  ```  T CreateInstance<T>(int ctorParameter)  {      if (RuntimeFeature.HasJit)      {          // Since this runtime has a JIT, use refemit to construct a specialized method          if(cachedFactoryMethodDelegate == null)          {              DynamicMethod factoryMethod = new DynamicMethod(...);              // Emit some IL to instantiate T              cachedFactoryMethodDelegate = (Func<int, T>)factoryMethod.CreateDelegate(typeof(Func<int, T>));           }           return cachedFactoryMethodDelegate(ctorParameter);      }      else      {          // No JIT, just use reflection          ConstructorInfo ctorInfo = typeof(T).GetConstructor(new Type[] { typeof(int)});          return (T)ctorInfo.Invoke(ctorParameter);       }  }

29254	area-System.Reflection	System.Reflection.Emit: ILGenerator.Emit(OpCodes.Ldtoken, <MethodInfo>) produces incorrect metadata for methods with C# 7.2 `in` parameters in generic types	"@TAGC recently noted in https://github.com/castleproject/Core/issues/339#issuecomment-372605885 that DynamicProxy-based mocking libraries (e.g. Moq, NSubstitute) appear to have problems mocking the following generic interface:    > ```csharp  > public interface IGenericStructByRefConsumer<T>  > {  >     T Consume(in Struct message);  > }  > ```    Mocking such a type will typically result in a `MissingMethodException`. It only seems to occur with generic types/methods, and in the presence of a C# 7.2 `in` parameter modifier.    I've been able to track this down to what appears to be a bug in System.Reflection.Emit. A brief description follows below; if more detail or code is required, I can probably provide it... please ask.    ---    Given this C# 7.2+ interface:    ```csharp  public interface WithIn<T>  {      void Method(in int arg);  }  ```    <details>  <summary>(Expand to see the equivalent type definition in IL.)</summary>    ```  .class public abstract interface auto ansi WithIn`1<T>  {    .method public hidebysig newslot abstract virtual instance void Method([in] int32& modreq([mscorlib]System.Runtime.InteropServices.InAttribute) arg) cil managed    {      .param [1]      .custom instance void [mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsReadOnlyAttribute::.ctor() = ( 01 00 00 00 )     }  }  ```  </details>  <br>    DynamicProxy would need to generate the following IL instruction sequence using a `System.Reflection.Emit.ILGenerator` (because it caches `MethodInfo` for proxied methods):    ```  ldtoken    method instance void class WithIn`1<int32>::Method(int32& modreq([mscorlib]System.Runtime.InteropServices.InAttribute))  ldtoken    class WithIn`1<int32>  call       class [mscorlib]System.Reflection.MethodBase   ```    This is how one would supposedly do it with `ILGenerator`:    ```csharp  var methodType = typeof(WithIn<int>);  var method = methodType.GetMethod(""Method"");  var getMethodFromHandle = typeof(MethodBase).GetMethod(""GetMethodFromHandle"", new[] { typeof(RuntimeMethodHandle), typeof(RuntimeTypeHandle) });    ilGenerator.Emit(OpCodes.Ldtoken, method);  // <-- !!!  ilGenerator.Emit(OpCodes.Ldtoken, methodType);  ilGenerator.EmitCall(OpCodes.Call, getMethodFromHandle, null);  ```    I've verified (by saving the dynamic assembly to disk using the .NET Framework 4.7, then dumping it with ILDASM) that the following IL is generated instead:    ```  ldtoken    method instance void class WithIn`1<int32>::Method(int32&)  ldtoken    class WithIn`1<int32>  call       class [mscorlib]System.Reflection.MethodBase [mscorlib]System.Reflection.MethodBase::GetMethodFromHandle(valuetype [mscorlib]System.RuntimeMethodHandle,  ```    Note the absence of the `modreq` in the first instruction's method reference. This will result in a `MissingMethodException` (because method signatures don't match) when the generated code is run:    > System.MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'Void IWithIn`1.Method(Int32 ByRef)'.    The same `MissingMethodException` occurs with .NET Core 2.0, so I suspect it inherited the exact same problem from the .NET Framework. If you'd rather have repro code for .NET Core, you'll find it below.    <details>  <summary>(Expand for an error reproduction on .NET Core.)</summary>    ```csharp  using System;  using System.Diagnostics;  using System.Reflection;  using System.Reflection.Emit;    public interface WithIn<T>  {      void Method(in int arg);  }    class Program  {      static void Main()      {          var methodType = typeof(WithIn<int>);          var method = methodType.GetMethod(""Method"");          var getMethodFromHandle = typeof(MethodBase).GetMethod(""GetMethodFromHandle"", new[] { typeof(RuntimeMethodHandle), typeof(RuntimeTypeHandle) });            var assemblyBuilder = AssemblyBuilder.DefineDynamicAssembly(new AssemblyName(""DynamicAssembly""), AssemblyBuilderAccess.Run);          var moduleBuilder = assemblyBuilder.DefineDynamicModule(""DynamicModule"");          var typeBuilder = moduleBuilder.DefineType(""DynamicType"", TypeAttributes.Public | TypeAttributes.Abstract | TypeAttributes.Class);            var methodBuilder = typeBuilder.DefineMethod(""Get"", MethodAttributes.Public | MethodAttributes.Static, typeof(MethodBase), new Type[0]);          var ilBuilder = methodBuilder.GetILGenerator();          ilBuilder.Emit(OpCodes.Ldtoken, method);          ilBuilder.Emit(OpCodes.Ldtoken, methodType);          ilBuilder.EmitCall(OpCodes.Call, getMethodFromHandle, null);          ilBuilder.Emit(OpCodes.Ret);            var type = typeBuilder.CreateType();            var il = type.GetMethod(""Get"").GetMethodBody().GetILAsByteArray();          Debug.Assert(il[0] == OpCodes.Ldtoken.Value, ""First op-code is not `ldtoken`."");            var ilMethodMetadataToken = BitConverter.ToInt32(il, 1);          Debug.Assert(type.Module.ResolveMethod(ilMethodMetadataToken) == method, ""First `ldtoken` does not refer to the correct method."");      }  }  ```  </details>  <br>    Note again that this problem only occurs for methods in generic types/methods, and in the presence of an `in` parameter modifier.    /cc @jonorossi (for DynamicProxy), @zvirja (for NSubstitute), @thomaslevesque (for FakeItEasy)"

29243	area-System.Net	Add DecompressionMethods.All?	The addition of `System.Net.DecompressionMethods.Brotli` was [recently approved](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26995). I have been writing `DecompressionMethods.Deflate | DecompressionMethods.GZip` in my source automatically; since I don't want to exclude the possibility of Brotli, I'm going to be writing `DecompressionMethods.Deflate | DecompressionMethods.GZip | DecompressionMethods.Brotli`.    I am very interested in an `All` member, since that sums up exactly what I care about.     ```diff  namespace System.Net  {      [Flags]      public enum DecompressionMethods      {          None = 0,          GZip = 1,          Deflate = 2,          Brotli = 4,  +       All = ~None      }  }  ```    Would you please review this possibility?

29233	area-System.Net	[release/2.1] Ensure LocalCertificateSelectionCallback is still called with AuthenticateAsServerAsync	In .NET Core 2.0, we call LocalCertificateSelectionCallback to choose the certificate during AuthenticateAsServerAsync. As part of adding support for SNI, this functionality was removed. However, some users have already implemented SNI using LocalCertificateSelectionCallback, and we should aim to maintain compatibility for them.    This change ensures that we maintain the old behavior of LocalCertificateSelectionCallback when the new SNI callback is not set.    The fix has been merged into master in [this commit](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/commit/eeea6babf28188887f99aa0b459dc5877b39f31e).    See issue #29110 for details.    cc: @karelz

29226	area-Meta	De-duplicate resource ID's to make Mono merge easier	"When Mono pulls in CoreFX code they factor their assemblies like .NET Framework. This means .resx files from multiple libraries must get merged. When those libraries have resources with the same ID, and the string is not identical, this will not merge.    Below is a list I grepped out of all cases where we use a resource ID for multiple distinct string values. In some cases the difference is whitespace so it isn't visible.     1. Where it's a trivial spacing/punctuation/quoting difference we should keep the ID and make the strings the same  1. Where the string is clearly intended to be distinct, we should disambiguate the ID's and update the code to match.

29218	area-Infrastructure	CoreFx needs to version assemblies in the shared framework past those which are OOB and have different surface area	"Previously whenever we added API to a contract or moved types down we had to version the assembly.  This was necessary because the contract was meant to be a portable representation along a single timeline of the API.    Up to this point we haven't cared about the assembly version when adding .NETCore-specific API.  This was because we were viewing .NETCore as a ""fork"" of the contract.  We could imagine .NETCore having more API than the portable view of the contract since the portable view was constrained by what was in other frameworks/netstandard.    Not caring about this was OK because there was never the case that someone would be getting a different assembly when targeting .NETCore: all those .NETCore specific assemblies were in the same package and/or in the framework package for targeting .NETCore.    This has changed since we started allowing framework roll-forward.  Framework roll-forward allows for a snapshot of the asset resolution for an older framework to be used on a newer framework.  This breaks the assumption I mentioned above.    This will cause a problem whenever we   1. Permit a package to provide an asset on a previous version of  .NETCore.  2. The same assembly in that package has significantly different API that would have caused us to version the contract in the newer version of .NETCore:    a. Added API    b. Forwarded API in the reference assembly.    c. *Forwarded API in the implementation assembly* - I need to think through this more to understand if this is an issue.  My gut feel is that it is, since some other assembly might be compiling against implementation assemblies and expect the type to exist at the forwarded location.  In practice we may be able to rely on B in order to force things that might compile against  implementation into non-oob mode.    This need not be in two different versions of the package and indeed is a problem at steady state.    Consider the System.Memory issue https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29032.  We build a netstandard2.0 version of System.Memory that defines all the types as living in System.Memory.  We build a netcoreapp2.1 version that has forwarded the types down to System.Runtime.  Today these have the same assembly version, and if they are from the same build have the same file version as well.  An application uses System.Memory and targets netcoreapp2.0.  At runtime the application is rolled forward to netcoreapp2.1.  Today if the version is the same the applocal copy will be preferred.  I'll assert that is a bug and inconsistent with the way build works: https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/4047.  Ignoring that, if a newer package of System.Memory was used the same will happen.  This is a problem.  At steady state the System.Memory package will contain a netstandard2.0 asset and nothing in our current versioning policy will cause us to bump the inbox version.    To address this issue I propose that we need to increase the assembly version of the implementation assembly in NETCoreApp whenever the netcoreapp version will have different API than another reference in the same package.  This is more than is needed: technically the only requirement is that we do this whenever the older API surface would have been oob-able to a previous roll-forward capable framework but that feels like too specific of a rule to maintain.    Perhaps we can implement the more specific rule in 2.1 to limit the churn, then start following the generic rule in 2.2.    /cc @weshaggard     "

However they are converted to hex in a wrong way: 7.43.0 becomes 0x074300 but it should be 0x072B00.

29212	area-Serialization	DataContractJsonSerializer.CanonicalizeObject() 	There is an alternative to https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-erdtman-jose-cleartext-jws-00.html in preparation which in addition to ES6 compatible string and number generation (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/5647), also requires that property names are _sorted_ as described in: https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/security/draft-rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme.html.    This is trivial to accomplish in **Json.NET** through an extra parameter to the serializer (https://github.com/cyberphone/json-canonicalization/blob/master/dotnet/newtonsoft/Program.cs#L32), but using the DataContractJsonSerializer I'm stuck.    One way to achieve this would be to add a specific method` CanonicalizeObject()` , that would be identical to `WriteObject()` except for property order.  Well, it would enforce ES6 compatible string and number generation as well.

29208	area-System.Diagnostics	Introduce public setter for Activity 	See #29207
29207	area-System.Diagnostics	Public setter for System.Diagnostics.Activity.Current	"# Motivation     `Activity` represents a context for distributed operation tracing.  It is created when an operation (e.g. Http request) starts and flows with async calls within a process.      `Activity.Current` is `AsyncLocal` static variable that any logger/tracing system can use to stamp logs and telemetry with 'correlation ids'.    `Activity.Current` could be set via calling `Activity.Start` or `Activity.Stop` which are enough as long as managed  asyncronous flow is guaranteed which is not always the case.    Typical example is ASP.NET application hosed with IIS where hop from managed to native thread chould happen at any step in the request execution pipeline. ASP.NET propagates `HttpContext` through such hops.    With current API, it is not possible to assign Current Activity 'back' to what it was before the hop.    # Proposed API    Add public setter for `Activity.Current`.     # Usage  Such method could be called from the certain points in the request execution pipeline:  ```csharp  public void RestoreActivityIfNeeded(HttpContext context)  {      if (Activity.Current == null)      {          var storedActivity = (Activity)context.Items[""AspNetActivityKey""];          if (storedActivity != null)          {              Activity.Current = storedActivity; //!!!          }      }  }  ```    # Details  * stopped/not started Activities *should not* be allowed as it makes Current stack *invalid*. E.g.    ```csharp      Activity.Current = stopped;      Activity.Current.Stop();  // Noop, never changes Current to Parent  ```    ```csharp      Activity.Current = notStarted;      notStarted.Stop() // Noop, never changes Current to Parent  ```    * arguably, Activity.Current = null is valid. E.g. fork a background task with no context without stopping all stack    ```csharp    Activity a = new Activity(""incoming request"").Start();    Task.Run(() => {      Activity.Current = null;      // start long-running task  });    // continune execution in the same context  ```    # Pull Request   Proposed changes: #29208    cc @vancem            "

Is there a workaround the customer could put in his app to make this work? It seems like TraceInternal.AppName should be checking for null and using something else for its value.

29174	area-System.Memory	Correctness checking and perf improvements on ReadOnlySequence	Currently APIs like `ReadOnlySequence<T>.Slice(SequencePosition, ...)` cannot validate certain aspects of their input parameters (such as that the provided _SequencePosition_ parameters are actually within the _this_ object) without incurring an O(n) traversal through the linked list of segments, where _n_ is the number of segments in the list. One option is to forego validation of the input parameters in this respect, but at the cost of the developer encountering undefined behavior in their application. A better solution would be to make validation constant-time so that the developer gets the benefit of parameter validation with minimal cost.    One potential way to do this would be to add a `public object Tag { get; protected set; }` property on the `ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T>` type. The general idea is that the tag identifies the linked list that this segment belongs to, and every segment within that linked list should reference the same tag object. The onus is on the creator of the individual segments to set the correct value. (By convention I'd recommend that _Tag_ point to the last segment in the linked list, but the particular implementation doesn't matter as long as the tags for each segment have referential equality.) When the developer calls any API on `ReadOnlySequence<T>` that accepts a `SequencePosition` parameter, the API would check that the parameter's backing `ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T>.Tag` object has referential equality to the `ReadOnlySequence<T>.Start`'s own backing `ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T>.Tag`. If the tags don't match, then the provided _SequencePosition_ doesn't belong to this instance, and the API should throw.    Additionally, as a potential optimization, the `ReadOnlySequence<T>` type could forego its existing logic of trying to special-case `T[]` vs. `string` vs `MemoryManager<T>` vs `ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T>` and could say simply that its own _SequencePosition_ instances are _always_ backed by a `ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T>`. In some cases this may result in an allocation internally, but this may pay for itself by resulting in much simpler / faster logic in `Slice` and other routines. The allocation penalty could also be optimized by having a custom internal `ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T>`-derived type with a finalizer and pulling a pooling trick [similar to what `PinnableBufferCache` does](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/parent/parent/parent/InternalApis/NDP_Common/inc/PinnableBufferCache.cs,4a9f14fd83c457e5). It also has the added benefit that `ReadOnlySequence<T>` would no longer try to reach into `Memory<T>`'s internals, which could provide better support in the future if we add a direct `void*` constructor to that type.    This latter optimization would be purely an implementation detail of `ReadOnlySequence<T>` and wouldn't change the public API surface. When combined with the _Tag_ proposal mentioned earlier, I think this is compelling in that it provides fast, robust parameter validation and simpler runtime logic for common operations.

The targets addressed on this change were identified via debugger by selecting calls that were putting errors on the SSL queue.

29170	area-System.Memory	MemoryExtensions.Equals with StringComparison	I'm trying to check for certain file extensions with the new `Span` APIs. I came across some odd behavior. Here's where I started, which, of course, only works for case-insensitive cases (i.e. Linux):    ```  foreach (var extension in _extensionsToWatch)  {      if (Path.GetExtension(entry.FileName).SequenceEqual(extension))          return true;  }  ```    `SequenceEqual` doesn't have a case-insensitive overload, so I found     `if (MemoryExtensions.Equals(Path.GetExtension(entry.FileName), extension, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))` which works.    But I like to call extension methods as extension methods, so I rewrite this as    `if (Path.GetExtension(entry.FileName).Equals(extension, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))`    But now I get a compiler error    > Member 'object.Equals(object, object)' cannot be accessed with an instance reference; qualify it with a type name instead    OK, that's odd. Shouldn't it have picked up the `MemoryExtensions` extension method used above?    Now this next one I stumbled into on accident    `if (Path.GetExtension(entry.FileName).Equals((extension, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)))`    The difference is subtle, but all I did was add some redundant(?) parentheses. No compiler error, but I get a runtime error    > System.NotSupportedException: 'Equals() on Span and ReadOnlySpan is not supported. Use operator== instead.'    So now it is telling me to use the `==` operator, which, I assume, will do a case-sensitive comparison, which is the opposite of what I want, and is not valid replacement for `StringComparison`.    Why are things not working like I think they should?

As part of adding support for SNI, this functionality was removed. However, some users have already implemented SNI using `LocalCertificateSelectionCallback`, and we should aim to maintain compatibility for them.

I also added two tests to verify this behavior.    Fixes: #29110

29150	area-System.Data	new SqlDouble(NaN) is only allowed on NETFX	SqlDouble has a weird platform difference:  ```cs          public SqlDouble(double value)          {  #if !netfx              if (!double.IsFinite(value))  #else              if (double.IsInfinity(value) || double.IsNaN(value))  #endif              {                  throw new OverflowException(SQLResource.ArithOverflowMessage);              }              else              {                  m_value = value;                  m_fNotNull = true;              }          }  ```  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Data.Common/src/System/Data/SQLTypes/SQLDouble.cs#L40    This means I can insert NaN values when not using the .NET Framework, but when running the same code on a different platform, I get a crash here.  Easy to reproduce:  ```  new SqlDouble(double.NaN); //Crashes on NETFX  ```    This is rather problematic because NaN is commonly used in the SqlGeometry and SqlGeography datatypes to represent Z and M values, where for instance a line generally contains Z measurements, but on some vertices they might not be available. The behavior is described in [Microsoft SQL Server CLR Types Serialization Formats ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee320529(v=sql.105).aspx) on Page 9:    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1378165/38840339-f587cb66-4193-11e8-8ea6-ed0038daaded.png)  
29149	area-Infrastructure	Dependency bug with System.Memory in net461	Repro project: https://github.com/anurse/SpanDependencyBug    Steps:  1. Create `net461` project  2. Reference `System.Memory`  3. Use `Span<T>.IndexOf`    Expected Result: You get the index!    Actual Result:    ```  Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Numerics.Vectors, Version=4.1.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.     at System.SpanHelpers.IndexOf(Char& searchSpace, Char value, Int32 length)     at System.MemoryExtensions.IndexOf[T](ReadOnlySpan`1 span, T value)     at SpanDependencyBug.Program.Main(String[] args)  ```    I believe this is cause by the fact that System.Memory depends on the following for `net45` (see https://dotnet.myget.org/feed/dotnet-core/package/nuget/System.Memory).    * System.Buffers (>= 4.4.0)  * System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe (>= 4.5.0-preview3-26416-06)    We are building for `net461` in the sample, but the `net45` dependencies are chosen over the `netstandard2.0` ones because NuGet finds an exact target framework name match (**unless this logic has changed since I last knew how this worked ;)**).    At runtime, `System.Memory` only provides a `netstandard2.0` binary, so it loads that binary, which references `System.Numerics.Vectors`, and thus blows up. System.Memory's references:    ```  // netstandard, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51  // System.Numerics.Vectors, Version=4.1.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a  // System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe, Version=4.0.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a  // System.Buffers, Version=4.0.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51  // mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089  ```

29139	area-System.Data	SqlClient UDT support needs an assembly-plugin model	I built a .NET Standard implementation of the `Microsoft.SqlServer.Types` classes. This works great for insertion, but when deserializing I'll get an exception like this:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1378165/38794079-b34e7df2-4108-11e8-9ca1-7631c9c50840.png)    Instead I have to write something like:    ```cs  var binvalue = reader.GetSqlBytes(rowid);  var g = SqlGeometry.Deserialize(binvalue);  ```    This makes sense, because SqlClient has no idea I provided an implementation it could use. Assembly redirect only works for assemblies with the same name and public key, so that's not really an option.  How do we across all the different platforms allow us to use UDT in assemblies defined on each platform, and get the SqlClient to import the types?    The issue is somewhat called out in the doc:  > SqlClient may fail to load a UDT in the event of mismatched UDT versions or other problems.

Focus on optimization to win back **most** of the performance regression.    We are now **actually faster** than what was in master previously in almost all cases (by up to 15%). The major outliers which still regressed are:  ```C#  Slice(SequencePosition start); // only for multi segment sequence  Slice(SequencePosition start, SequencePosition end); // only for multi segment sequence  ```    This is predominantly because _correct_ bounds checking for multi-segment sequences is inherently more complex. There may still be some room for clever tricks here.    Using the performance tests from https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/29133:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6527137/38789869-046d5e36-40f2-11e8-99b0-dd11f1de2e23.png)    Also includes changes from https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/29072 / https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/29088    cc @pakrym, @AlexRadch, @KrzysztofCwalina, @davidfowl  
29134	area-System.Memory	Marshaling of Default and Empty ReadOnlySequence	Early ReadOnlySequences works incorrect with default value. Now it is fixed except marshaling methods.    Now if we try to marshal Default ROS it will be converted to Default ReadOnlyMemory. But if we try to create ROS for default ReadOnlyMemory then Empty ROS will be created.    So marshaling change Default ROS to Empty ROS. Is it issue?    If we try to marshal Empty ROS it can be marshaled and ArraySegment or ReadOnlyMemory with length equal to 0. And if we create ROS for ArraySegment or ReadOnlyMemory then Empty ROS will be created. So both ways are correct.

29132	area-System.Net	change sync timeout handling back to use actual sync timeouts	Fixes #29040     We made a change in 2.1 (#22588) to force sync operations with timeout to go through the sync-over-async path.  This caused a nontrivial perf hit.      This change reverts (mostly) the previous change and fixes the original issue by checking explicitly for blocking mode and not retrying when a timeout is exceeded.    Also, remove timeout handling from accept and connect operations since it is never used.    @stephentoub @dotnet/ncl 
29131	area-System.Net	Delete faulty assert in SslStreamInternal	We're hitting an assert when a ReadAsync call is made on SslStream after the underlying stream encounters EOF.  When calling FillBufferAsync, we've already allocated the read buffer, and we may not have any data in the buffer; if we then hit EOF, we've still not got any data in the buffer and we return.  Then when ReadAsync is called again, the assert trips over the buffer being allocated and also being empty.    The fix is to call ReturnReadBufferIfEmpty when we hit EOF, so that we promptly free the buffer.  But I'm also deleting the failing assert, as it seems like we could hit this in other situations as well.    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29127  cc: @geoffkizer, @Drawaes, @davidsh 
29130	area-System.Net	Fix nestedRead tracking in SslStreamInternal.ReadAsyncInternal	_nestedRead is getting reset back to 0 at the end of an iteration of the loop, but it may be looping back around again to do more reading.  If we're going to try to protect against concurrent reads, we should at least do it right :)    cc: @Drawaes, @geoffkizer, @davidsh
29129	area-System.IO	FileStream.Windows useAsync WriteAsync calls blocking apis	e.g SetEndOfFile in the async path is 50% of the time and it doesn't need to be called (as WriteFile will expand the File).     SetEndOfFile is also a blocking api itself; so expanding the file using it blocks the thread for as much time (or more) as the async saves blocking.    ---  Previous    Seen in https://github.com/electricessence/AsyncFileWriter/pull/1 (Windows 10; netcoreapp2.0 and netcoreapp2.1)    Non-async (just for `FileStream.Write`)  ```  AsyncFileWriterTester>dotnet run -c Release  100,000 bounded capacity.

To do that, I need to first generate *PDB/MDB* files and I found and heard that one can generate Portable PDB files by using APIs from the `System.Reflection.Metadata` namespace. But I just can't find any documentations on or about it, nor source codes that apparently use them.  So, is here the right place to ask it? If so, would you mind if I ask how to use the APIs?

29120	area-System.Runtime	ApiProposal: string.Create method which takes an additional Span as data parameter	"With the new ``Span<>`` based Apis an additional method to create strings was added which takes the length and an action + state as parameter to allow alloc-free modification of the string based on the action.  The signature is:  ```csharp   public static string Create<TState>(int length, TState state, SpanAction<char, TState> action)  ```  An example of the usage is in @stephentoub's article https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx    I propose an additional method taking a ``ReadonlySpan<char>`` as parameter to be able to populate the new string more easily. It is currently not possible to use a custom TState with ``ReadOnlySpan<char>`` as a field, because such byref structs can't be type parameters, so the current method does not solve the problem.    **Rationale and Usage**  With span it is easy to create a substring and trim and such apis are included with ``Span``. Sometimes it might be useful to simply remove certain characters from a string, where you know the new length of the string in advance. One example is unescaping data, see the code snippet below for usage, the new length of the string can be easily calculated in advance, so a fixed size buffer is enough.    **Proposed API**    ```csharp   public delegate void SpanDataAction<T, in TArg>(Span<T> span, in ReadOnlySpan<T> data, TArg arg);   public static string Create<TState>(int length, in ReadOnlySpan<char> data, TState state, SpanDataAction<char, TState> action);  ```  The new delegate is necessary to be able to use the data in the action.    **Example usage**  A shortened example of how to unescape a possible JSON span, in this example state is not used, but I imagine that State will be equally useful as in the original string.Create, so it is included in the proposal.  ```csharp  ReadOnlySpan<char> data = ""Hello\\nWorld""; // escaped newline  int length = data.Length - 1;  var output = Create(length, data, new State(),      delegate(Span<char> span, in ReadOnlySpan<char> input, State state)      {          var counter = 0;          for (int i = 0; i < input.Length; i++)          {              var c = input[i];              if (c == '\\')              {                  i++;                  c = input[i];                  switch (c)                  {                      case 'n':                          c = '\n';                          break;                  }              }                span[counter++] = c;          }      });  private readonly struct State {}   ```    **Proposed Implementation**    Modified from the existing string.Create  ```csharp  public static string Create<TState>(int length, in ReadOnlySpan<char> data, TState state, SpanDataAction<char, TState> action)  {      if (action == null)          throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(action));        if (length <= 0)      {          if (length == 0)              return string.Empty;          throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(length));      }        //Span<char> span = stackalloc char[length];      //action(span, data, state);      //return span.ToString();      string result = FastAllocateString(length);      action(new Span<char>(ref result.GetRawStringData(), length), data, state);      return result;  }  ```    **Impact**  Currently, as to my knowledge, you need to use either unsafe pointer logic and/or Unsafe.Write methods to replace the existing chars in the string.    **Open Questions**  * Better name for the delegate  * Better workarounds than unsafe logic?

I'm seeing this behavior with both an HttpClient and using the latest Azure Storage SDK.

29097	area-System.Net	Sockets: dispatch sync op handling back to calling thread to avoid thread starvation	Fixes #29029     This change ended up a little more involved than I'd hoped, unfortunately.    The main change is to handling of queued sync operations.  Instead of dispatching a threadpool item to process these, we instead signal the waiting thread to process the IO itself.  This solves the starvation issue.    Related to this, I also changed how cancellation for timeout on sync operations works.  The problem was that if a sync operation timed out, we'd still leave its operation in the queue.  So when we received a readiness notification, we'd try to signal the associated blocked thread -- but it would be no longer waiting because it timed out.  Instead, actually remove the timed out item from the queue, and handle any queue state fixup necessary from this.    @stephentoub @dotnet/ncl

29091	area-System.Net	Remap EBADF in SocketErrorPal.Unix.cs to OperationAborted	"Due to the way async operations on Socket are implemented on Unix, it's possible that a socket file descriptor could be closed and subsequent calls to methods like recvmsg as part of the async operation could report EBADF, meaning ""The argument sockfd is an invalid descriptor.""  As part of our PAL layer, we currently map this error to SocketError.InvalidArgument, as that's the most direct equivalent, but in practice since this only ever occurs when the socket file descriptor was valid and has been closed to become invalid, it's more logically associated with OperationAborted, with the operation having been effectively canceled due to the socket having been closed.  This matters for two reasons: 1) the resulting error message is more informative to the developer to help track down the cause (""Invalid argument"" can be misleading), and 2) code in various places checks for OperationAborted as a signal of cancellation / socket closure and would end up missing these cases.

29081	area-System.Net	Address some SocketsHttpHandler feedback	- We were using WriteAsciiStringAsync in one place we shouldn't have been.  Change it to WriteStringAsync.  - We were potentially overflowing in a multiplication on MaxResponseHeadersLength if it was set to a very large value.  Changed it to use long multiplication and to cap the max length at int.MaxValue.  - We were accidentally using DateTimeOffset.Now instead of UtcNow when getting the current time during stale pool removal.  Change to UtcNow.  - We had an unnecessary/unreachable catch block.  Remove it.  - In a race condition where the handler and thus its pool manager was disposed while the cleaning timer callback was in flight (either already queued or already running), we could potentially dispose of the timer and then the callback attempt to change the timer and incur an ObjectDisposedException that would go unhandled on a thread pool thread.  One fix would be to track disposal under the same lock that's used to mutate the cleaning timer, but that incurs the cost of tracking disposal and taking a lock on disposal in order to deal with a rare race condition (that we've never actually seen happen).  Instead, I opt to simply catch and eat any ODEs that occur.  - If either of the connection lifetime values are set at 0, we avoid putting connections back into a pool and thus also avoid creating the cleaning timer.  But we're still putting the created pool into the pools collection, which in theory in an extreme case could be a leak.  The fix is simply to not store the pool into the pools in this case.    cc: @GrabYourPitchforks, @geoffkizer, @davidsh

29064	area-System.Security	SSlStream on OSX High Sierra throws AuthenticationException when certificate revocation checking is enabled and the server’s certificate extensions includes a CRL but not OCSP 	"**Overview**  A .Net Core 2.0 application running on OSX High Sierra cannot connect to a server using SSLStream with certificate revocation checking enabled. The server’s certificate has extensions for CRLs but not OCSP. If one builds this application on Linux or Windows, the application will connect (to the same server) without any problems. Additionally, using the same certificate chain to host a web server via openssl s_server, Safari is able to connect on OSX without any problems.    **Exception details**  AuthenticationException message: Remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.   The sole X509ChainStatus in the X509Chain is on the leaf certificate: ""An incomplete certificate revocation check has occurred.""  The corresponding Apple error code is errSecIncompleteCertRevocationCheck (-67635) (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/errsecincompletecertrevocationcheck).    **Workaround**  1. If one can retarget the application to .NET Core 1.1 (which uses OpenSSL instead of the Apple Security Framework), the application will connect without problems. Note: the root certificate will have to be installed for OpenSSL.  2. An alternative is to disable certificate revocation checking in SSLStream, but this has security implications.    **Interesting observations**   1. The Apple result code is listed under ""OCSP result code"" (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1542001-security_framework_result_codes), and the certificates I was using did not support OCSP.   2. However, when connecting to a server ""B"" whose certificate chain did support OCSP as well as CRLs, I was able to connect without any problems. For completeness's sake, Server B's certificate also had the following X509v3 extensions that the first server ""A"" did not: X509v3 Subject Alternative Name, X509v3 Key Usage, X509v3 Extended Key Usage, X509v3 Certificate Policies, Authority Information Access, CT Precertificate SCTs.    **Additional thoughts**  I am admittedly a little uncertain if the problem is on Apple's end: i.e. the Apple Security Framework has additional restrictions (compared to CNG and OpenSSL) on what it considers to be a well-formed chain. My only hint that indicates otherwise is that that Safari is able to connect a webserver utilizing the same set of certificates.     **Reproduction steps**     Create a chain of certificates that mimics a certificate signed by DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server CA.    The following are the steps I used:   1. Create a self-signed root CA such that ""X509v3 Key Usage: Digital Signature, Certificate Sign, CRL Sign"".  2. Generate a CRL for the root CA, taking care that the CRL does _not_ have a X509v3 Issuing Distribution Point.  3. Create an intermediate certificate authority with the same key usage as the root CA and with a X509v3 Issuing Distribution Point (IDP) pointing to the CRL generated in step 2.  4. Generate a CRL for the intermediate CA. This CRL should contain an X509v3 IDP.  5. Create the server certificate ""A"" signed by the intermediate CA. This certificate should have an X509v3 IDP that matches the CRL generated in step 4.   6. Install the root CA certificate. On OSX, I used Keychain Access, adding the certificate to the login keychain. (I also tried adding the certificate to the system keychain).  7. Host a test server using openssl s_server  ""openssl s_server -port 44330 -key keyA.pem -cert certA.pem -CAfile intermediatecert.pem""   8. Create a test app that connects to the OpenSSL s_server using SslStream, calling AuthenticateAsClient with checkCertificateRevocation: true.     On Windows and Linux (after installing the root CA certificate), the  test app will connect without any problems, whereas the application will fail to connect on OSX.  However, as previously noted, if you use the same certificate to host a webserver (e.g.   ""openssl s_server -port 44330 -key keyA.pem -cert certA.pem -CAfile intermediatecert.pem -www""),   then Safari will be able to connect to that webserver without any problems.    I have reproduced this with the app targeting .NET Core 2.0 as well as 2.1 preview, using .NET Core SDK 2.1.300-preview1-008174. This also occurs when using SDK 2.1.104 (targeting .NET Core 2.0 only).    I've included my test app below for convenience:    ```c#  // Program.cs  using System;  using Ssl;  namespace crl_test_app {      class Program {          static void Main(string[] args) {              string serverCertificateName = ""tyche"";              string machineName = ""tyche"";              while (true) {                  Console.WriteLine(""Press enter to connect and send a message."");                  Console.ReadLine();                  Console.WriteLine(""Attempting to connect..."");                  SslTcpClient.RunClient(machineName, serverCertificateName);              }          }      }  }    // Ssl.cs  using System;  using System.IO;  using System.Linq;  using System.Net.Security;  using System.Net.Sockets;  using System.Security.Authentication;  using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;  using System.Text;    namespace Ssl {      public class SslTcpClient {             // Purely for debugging purposes, not needed          public static bool ValidateServerCertificate(                  object sender, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors) {              var errors = chain.ChainStatus.Aggregate("""", (str, x) => str + "","" + x.Status);              Console.WriteLine($""SslPolicyError: {sslPolicyErrors} {errors}"");                 foreach (var item in chain.ChainElements) foreach (var elemStatus in item.ChainElementStatus)                 Console.WriteLine(item.Certificate.Subject + ""->"" + elemStatus.StatusInformation);              return true;          }             public static void RunClient(string machineName, string serverName)  {              var socket = new Socket(SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);              socket.Connect(serverName, 44330);              Console.WriteLine(""Client connected."");                  using (var stream = new NetworkStream(socket)) {                                  var sslStream = new SslStream(innerStream: stream, leaveInnerStreamOpen: false,                      userCertificateValidationCallback: ValidateServerCertificate);                            try {                      sslStream.AuthenticateAsClientAsync(serverName, new X509Certificate2Collection(),                          SslProtocols.Tls12, checkCertificateRevocation: true).GetAwaiter().GetResult();                  } catch (AuthenticationException e) {                      Console.WriteLine(""Exception: {0}"", e.Message);                      if (e.InnerException != null)                          Console.WriteLine(""Inner exception: {0}"", e.InnerException.Message);                         Console.WriteLine(""Authentication failed - closing the connection."");                          return;                  }                     var w = new StreamWriter(sslStream);                  w.WriteLine(""Hello from the client."");                  w.Flush();                                      var serverMessage = ReadLine(new StreamReader(sslStream));                  Console.WriteLine(""Server says: {0}"", serverMessage);                  Console.WriteLine(""Press enter to close the connection."");                  Console.ReadLine();                               }                 socket.Dispose();              Console.WriteLine(""Client closed."");          }             static string ReadLine(StreamReader reader) => reader.ReadLine();             static void SendMessage(SslStream sslStream, string s=""Hello from the client."") =>              sslStream.Write(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(s));          }  }  ```  [edit: whitespace, typos]  [EDIT] Add C# syntax highlighting by @karelz  "

Invoking ref-return methods is not supported at this time but we already an in-progress issue to make it supported (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/15960)    Could also be used by existing Reflection Invoke api to pass null references as arguments.    # Alternatives considered    ### Return `Missing.Value` instead.    Pros: Saves us a little surface area.    Cons: This has received significant pushback from @vsadov:    > Missing.Value is used for many other purposes. DLR and VB latebinders, for example use Missing.Value to propagate the fact that user did not pass a particular argument to expected optional parameters.  > Returning Missing.Value in a case of a failure will lead to situations where it will be impossible to tell whether the invocation failed or succeeded and returned a Missing.Value.  >     Indeed, it is overloading a sentinel with a defined meaning (""caller chose not to supply optional parameter"") for something completely different.      ### Throw `NullReferenceException`    Pros: No ambiguity, for this particular api, this represents an attempt to dereference a null reference which is a programming error and there is precedent for `NullReferenceException` here.    Cons: Reflection Invoke throws all programming error-related exception before invoking the target method. This would be a new precedent as the exception would be thrown after a successful call of the target method."

29050	area-System.Net	Optimize proxy PAC file discovery process for SocketsHttpHandler	"This PR will reduce the calls to WinHTTP GetProxyForUrl() if a previous call recently discovered  no PAC file within a certain timeframe. We call this API when ""Automatically detect settings""  is turned on. The default configuration on Windows has this proxy setting always turned on. This  is ironic given that most network environments don't have a PAC file on the network. So, it's  important to try to optimize this common case on customers' networks.    Initial testing shows at least a 2x speed improvement with these changes. I used simple  constructs of using DateTime and TimeSpan comparisons instead of trying to further optimize this  using Environment.Ticks. Looking at the performance numbers, there is not any significant  improvement in speed compared with the best case of ""Automatically detect settings"" being turned  OFF in the first place.    I did not use any locking mechanisms since those would drag down performance. In the worst case,  any race condition would mean we might call GetProxyForUrl() an extra time. But since we're only  filtering on ERROR_WINHTTP_AUTODETECTION_FAILED, it is unlikely to actually change over time.  That particular error means that the WPAD protocol was able to complete on the network, but the  answer discovered is that there is no PAC file registered on the network.    Fixes #28543"

29029	area-System.Net	Synchronous socket methods on Unix requiring extra thread	"When just using synchronous methods on a Socket (e.g. Socket.Receive), the calls pass through to the corresponding synchronous methods in the OS (e.g. recvmsg)    However, when an asynchronous operation is issued on a Socket, it puts the underlying socket into non-blocking mode, and due to race conditions that would otherwise result, the socket is left in non-blocking mode for the remainder of its existence.  That means that subsequent synchronous calls to methods on Socket end up taking a sync-over-async path, where it initiates the operation and then blocks on an event that'll be signaled by the event loop when the operation completes.    In .NET Core 2.0 and earlier, that signaling took place on the event loop itself, e.g. with the event loop:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/665a428f353ad7c18a59b8d76ac6d4235038db3a/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketAsyncEngine.Unix.cs#L258  calling HandleEvents:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/665a428f353ad7c18a59b8d76ac6d4235038db3a/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketAsyncEngine.Unix.cs#L287  which would in turn call Complete on the queue:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/665a428f353ad7c18a59b8d76ac6d4235038db3a/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketAsyncContext.Unix.cs#L1523  which would in turn call TryCompleteAsync on operations:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/665a428f353ad7c18a59b8d76ac6d4235038db3a/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketAsyncContext.Unix.cs#L440-L442  which for these ""synchronous"" operations would wake them up by setting the event:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/665a428f353ad7c18a59b8d76ac6d4235038db3a/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketAsyncContext.Unix.cs#L116-L120    In .NET Core 2.1 unfortunately, that signaling is now taking place via a queued work item.  The event loop still calls HandleEvents:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/acb44e79ef7dc81817da9cf5f19c9819d0f491d1/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketAsyncContext.Unix.cs#L800-L801  but HandleEvents queues a work item to do the actual processing:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/acb44e79ef7dc81817da9cf5f19c9819d0f491d1/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketAsyncContext.Unix.cs#L838-L840  That was done for performance reasons for actual async operations, but for these synchronous operations, it creates a problem.    Let's say the thread pool contained a single thread.  If that thread was used to make the ""synchronous"" call, then that thread will end up blocking waiting for the operation to complete.  For it to complete, a work item gets posted to the thread pool, and that work item needs to be processed, but all of the threads in the pool are currently blocked.  So we end up waiting for the thread pool's starvation mechanism to kick in and introduce another thread. Now let's say the thread pool contains 10 threads and 10 such operations are initiated, each of which does a ""synchronous"" operation.  Now all 10 threads are blocked, and 10 work items are going to be queued to unblock them.    This can result in seconds of delay for each such operation, plus unnecessary growth in the thread pool."

29026	area-System.Runtime	Expose `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.SkipLocalsInitAttribute`	### Rationale  C# is exposing new functionality which allows you to drop the `init` flag from a method's `.local` directive (see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/25780 for more details).    It would be beneficial if CoreFX/NetStandard exposed this standard type so that users are not required to always manually define this type themselves.    ### Proposed API  ```  namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices  {      [AttributeUsage(AttributeUsage.All, Inherited = false)] // TODO: Update AttributeUsage based on the compiler spec      public sealed class SkipLocalsInitAttribute : Attribute      {          public SkipLocalsInitAttribute()          {          }      }  }  ```

I found this to be odd as the other methods do take a `CancellationToken` and pass it to `Task.Factory.FromAsync`; I guess `ShutdownAsync` could behave the same way.    If this was not intentional (and `ShutdownAsync` should indeed take a `CancellationToken`), I'd be happy to create a PR which implements that.
29022	area-System.IO	Support appending foreign buffers to pipe without copy	Moved from https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/issues/2031    Foreign buffers are buffers not allocated with the Pipe MemoryPool.    Use-cases (by @Drawaes @mgravell @ReubenBond)  - Send the same data to multiple Pipes  - Pass existing data that is not related to pipelines  - Embed existing data (e.g. add header)    With the current API, these buffers are copied into buffers owned by the Pipe MemoryPool:    Challenges:  - The buffer usage needs to be tracked in order to know when it can be re-used.  - some Transports (e.g. RIO) may not be capable of sending foreign buffers. They should detect this and copy the data in an appropriate buffer.    CC @davidfowl

29005	area-System.Net	Unobserved websocket task exceptions when attempting to read/write on non-existent connections	Valid repro: [WebSocketRepro.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1896745/WebSocketRepro.zip)    Firstly start server with `dotnet run -c Release`, then keep starting client with `dotnet run -c Release` until server app prints the exception we're looking for. Reproducing it might require a few tries, but I've never needed more than 3.    I reproduced it on both latest stable `2.1.103` SDK, as well as `2.1.300-preview1-008174`. This issue seems to be reproducible **only on Windows**, I had no luck running into this issue on linux.    As you can see in the source, we have generic try-catch all across entire flow, which should catch any potential exceptions (and does, we intentionally ignore them since this is working as intended). However, under special circumstances it's possible that we can receive unobserved exception instead, which isn't caught but instead thrown back on `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`. This doesn't influence the app in any significant way (it doesn't crash or stop working), but if this is expected then it should be observed, similar how it was done in other case I reported: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24002 (that has nothing to do with this one).    The exception we're looking for is:    ```  Reproduced! This should not happen: System.AggregateException: A Task's exception(s) were not observed either by Waiting on the Task or accessing its Exception property.

The test tries to detect what version of OpenSsl is loaded in order to decide which test cases are valid. The call we're actually using to do that is `SSLEay`. As documented in the RedHat 6.9 known issues, that value is not reported correctly:  ```  Because certain applications perform incorrect version check of the OpenSSL version, the actual   runtime version of OpenSSL is masked and the build-time version is reported instead. Consequently,  it is impossible to detect the currently running OpenSSL version using the SSLeay() function.  ```    The misreported version causes us to use a test case we would not otherwise, which then fails. This fix disables the test case on RedHat.

Using Win 10 x64 Fall Creators Update and .NET Core 2.1.104  I'm getting this when trying to run my game launcher:  https://i.imgur.com/WCzLzah.png (previously it was: BadImageException bla bla reference assemblies should not be loaded for execution bla bla; but after I downgraded System.Numerics.Vector to 4.4.0 - error changed to current one)    Can't understand why this happens. I'm referencing only System.Numerics.Vectors 4.4.0: https://i.imgur.com/YrZYU5t.png    Can this be a problem because of this: I'm making game engine, and dlls of my engine - like system, renderer, 3d engine, sound, network and so on - are Net Standard 2.0 (but I complie them using .NET Core 2.0 toolchain) to force me avoid windows-only functions and trying to keep cross-platform, but game launcher executable (that is just instantiate .net core's game dll that initialize engine) is .NET Framework 4.7.1.   Could this be a root of issue? If so, how it can be solved?    
28984	area-System.Net	Allow HTTPListener to grab unprotected ports on Windows	"@doyouevensunbro commented on [Mon Apr 09 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1413)  Currently, to get HTTPListener in .Net Core 2 I have to run the following block of code:    ```C#  if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows))  {      using (Process process = new Process())      {          var command = ""netsh.exe"";          var args = string.Format(""http add urlacl url=\""{0}\"" user=Everyone"", _host);                    process.StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo(command, args)          {              Verb = ""runas"",              UseShellExecute = true,          };          try          {              process.Start();              process.WaitForExit();          }          catch (Exception e)          {              Log.Error(Tag, ""Couldn't set HTTPListener permissions: "", e);              throw;          }      }  }  ```    I'm assuming that this is for security reasons (I'm more familiar with Linux over Windows, and HTTPListener works without issue on those platforms). So I tried listening to the port using TcpListener and had no issues. I'm a bit confused by this since I can write a HTTP server using a TcpListener, there are libraries out there that do it now.     Any chance we can change .Net Core 2 to do the same, or this is a Windows issue that can't be bypassed?    Thanks!  "

28980	area-System.Net	Clear SSL error queue after MultiDestroy and MultiRemoveHandle	Part 3 of separating PR #28862: Clear SSL error queue after MultiDestroy and MultiRemoveHandle (CurlHandler).    These methods wrap calls to SSL_shutdown that can leave unwanted errors on the SSL error queue.     There is no return to indicate if an error happened, so whenever MultiDestroy and MultiRemoveHandle are called a corresponding call to ErrClearError was added.
28979	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler does not work on single core machines	While trying to repro an issue on Win7 I have been running into consistent failures in all tests using Http. I think that it is a result of the changes introduced in PR #28638.     The assertion being hit is on line 48 of ConcurrentQueue_Segment.cs. `boundedLength` has a value of 1.  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/943e316297df4b0767e46dbb87f97ea861c6817e/src/Common/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentQueue_Segment.cs#L47-L49    The assertion is failing because of the following lines in SocketsHttpHandler ConnectHelper:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/943e316297df4b0767e46dbb87f97ea861c6817e/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/SocketsHttpHandler/ConnectHelper.cs#L19-L22    When the processor count is 1, RoundUpToPowerOf2 returns 1 (2<sup>0</sup>...), which is below the lower bound enforced by ConcurrentQueue. The failures don't repro in CI because all of the test machines have more than one core.    cc: @stephentoub @davidsh

(see further down https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28969#issuecomment-379979579) - though `null` `ref`s are odd?    ### Rational    So C#7.3 is outish now https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-preview-relnotes#csharp and it supports:  ```  Custom `fixed` statement:   Types that implement a suitable `GetPinnableReference` can be used in a `fixed` statement.  ```  However, this method on span has been moved to `MemoryMarshal.GetReference` so span cannot participate directly in a `fixed` statement.    To allow direct using a fixed statement the methods should be returned; **with the caveat** of adding the attribute `[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]` so the route for a user getting a reference remaining via `MemoryMarshal`    cc @davidfowl, @GrabYourPitchforks, @stephentoub, @KrzysztofCwalina, @pakrym, @ahsonkhan @jkotas

Only improve the perf hit from SocketsHttpHandler side.  2. Introduce `WinHttpDetectAutoProxyConfigUrl`. When ""Automatic detect settings"" is checked, we will call into this function to see if we can auto detect config file.  3. If we are not able to auto detect config file and ""Use automatic configuration script"" is turned off, we can safely skip calling into WinHttpGetProxyForUrl.  4. Add timer optimization for calling `WinHttpDetectAutoProxyConfigUrl`. We don't call it per request, instead call it every 2 minutes, cache/update the info, to improve performance.

Install package called `gss-ntlmssp` (plugin into MIT Kerberos GSSAPI layer)  2. Install Heimdal (alternative Kerberos implementation with NTLM support): https://www.h5l.org/manual/heimdal-1-5-branch/ntlm/    One of the options installed is sufficient to make SocketHttpHandler work for NTLM without any additional changes to CoreFX or the app.    **Details:**  .NET Core 2.0 / 2.1 with libcurl works fine. This is because curl has it's own implementation but SocketHttpHandler depends on authentication code shared with NegotiateStream class.    The shared authentication depends on GSSAPI and that is typically provided by MIT kerberos. (this is also true for 2.1.300 preview docker images)  It does not have ability to do NTLM.     This is follow up on #27876 and #27872. This may be also related to  https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/943

28959	area-System.Memory	Remove SequenceMarshal.TryGetMemoryManager for ReadOnlySequence	This API was added as part of https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27097 when we had a ReadOnlySequence ctor that takes a MemoryManager. Based on the `Memory<T>` [usage guidelines](https://gist.github.com/GrabYourPitchforks/4c3e1935fd4d9fa2831dbfcab35dffc6), ReadOnlySequence is a consumer of Memory and not an owner. Therefore, we removed that ctor, when we split OwnedMemory into MemoryManager and IMemoryOwner, here (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/28640).    There is no longer a need to have an API that requires a MemoryManager from a ReadOnlySequence. **There are no calls to this method in corefx/ASP.NET and it is no longer relevant.**    We already have a method on MemoryMarshal to get MemoryManager from a ReadOnlyMemory, which should be sufficient for any meaningful scenarios.  ```C#  public static bool TryGetMemoryManager<T, TManager>(ReadOnlyMemory<T> memory, out TManager manager) where TManager : MemoryManager<T> { throw null; }  ```    ```diff  namespace System.Runtime.InteropServices  {      public static partial class SequenceMarshal      {  -        public static bool TryGetMemoryManager<T>(ReadOnlySequence<T> sequence, out MemoryManager<T> manager, out int start, out int length) { throw null; }      }  }  ```    cc @davidfowl, @pakrym, @GrabYourPitchforks, @KrzysztofCwalina, @terrajobst, @benaadams

Since the developer needs to be careful with the use of this API (it can be considered unsafe, for instance, if someone calls it on an array that isn't already pre-pinned), we should consider moving it to MemoryMarshal instead, but not hide it.    ```diff  namespace System  {      public readonly partial struct Memory<T>      {  -        [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]  -        public static Memory<T> CreateFromPinnedArray(T[] array, int start, int length) { throw null; }      }  }    namespace System.Runtime.InteropServices  {      public static partial class MemoryMarshal      {  +        public static Memory<T> CreateFromPinnedArray(T[] array, int start, int length) { throw null; }      }  }  ```    cc @davidfowl, @GrabYourPitchforks, @stephentoub, @KrzysztofCwalina, @pakrym, @benaadams

Here is an outline of the code:    ```csharp  var user_agent = ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.18 Safari/537.36"";    using (var handler = new HttpClientHandler())  using (var client = new HttpClient(handler))  {      var message = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, ""http://lvh.me:8000/yboe63yb"");        message.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(""User-Agent"", user_agent);      message.Content = new StringContent(RuntimeInformation.FrameworkDescription, Encoding.UTF8);        await client.SendAsync(message);  }  ```    After completion of the request, here is the capture according to a local instance of [requestbin](https://github.com/Runscope/requestbin), but this has also been validated against other echoing services:    ```  POST /yboe63yb HTTP/1.1  Content-Length: 22  Accept-Language: en-US, en; q=0.8  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br  Host: lvh.me:8000  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng*/*;q=0.8  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0, (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3), AppleWebKit/537.36, (KHTML, like Gecko), Chrome/63.0.3239.18, Safari/537.36  Connection: keep-alive  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8    .NET Core 4.6.26310.01  ```    In that output you will see that it appears to be treating that header as a collection of header value entries and is inserting "", "" between all the components.

28944	area-System.Text	Add a GetEncodings method to System.Text.EncodingProvider to support enumerating available character encodings	This API proposal arose out of #28915.    ## Rationale and Use Cases    As of this writing:    * [`System.Text.Encoding.GetEncodings()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.getencodings?view=netcore-2.1#System_Text_Encoding_GetEncodings) only ever enumerates the _default_ encodings available.    * [`System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.codepagesencodingprovider.instance?view=netcore-2.1#System_Text_CodePagesEncodingProvider_Instance) lacks a method for enumerating _additional_ encodings registered via [`System.Text.Encoding.RegisterProvider(EncodingProvider)`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.registerprovider?view=netcore-2.1), which - via a call to `System.Text.Encoding.RegisterProvider(System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance)` - makes the [Windows code-page character encodings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd317756(v=vs.85).aspx) available to .NET Core.    However, **it is desirable to have the ability to enumerate _all_ available encodings**:    * Even in the abstract it seems like an awkward omission not to be able to reflect on the available encodings; more concretely, consider the following use cases, both related to [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell):    * PowerShell Core commands such as `Get-Content` for reading text files support an `-Encoding` parameter that directly accepts `System.Text.Encoding` instances, so  users expect to be able to _discover_ all available encodings and/or be assisted in selecting a specific encoding with _tab completion_:  ```powershell  Get-Content file.txt -Encoding <tab-keypress>  # should show all available encodings  ```    *  Similarly, a [green-lighted, but not yet implemented](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6201) `Convert-TextFile` command will allow conversion between all available character encodings, so their discovery / ease of selection is important there too.    ## Proposed API    Add a `GetEncodings()` method to abstract class [`System.Text.EncodingProvider`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/103639b6ff5aa6ab6097f70732530e411817f09b/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Text/EncodingProvider.cs):    ```csharp  namespace System.Text  {      public abstract class EncodingProvider      {        // ...        // New virtual method, analogous to System.Text.Encoding.GetEncodings()        public virtual System.Text.EncodingInfo[] GetEncodings ();        // ...  ```    And [`System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Text.Encoding.CodePages/src/System/Text/CodePagesEncodingProvider.Default.cs) would then implement that method to return the encodings it provides.    Specifically, a call to `System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance.GetEncodings()` would then return the array of `System.Text.EncodingInfo` instances representing that provider's encodings.    As with `System.Text.Encodings.GetEncodings()`, no particular enumeration order is guaranteed.    ---    ### Integration into `System.Text.Encodings.GetEncodings()`    Once `System.Text.Encoding.RegisterProvider(System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance)` has been called, `System.Text.Encodings.GetEncodings()` will enumerate the additional encodings too, using the newly introduced method on the provider _if_ registered.    In other words: `System.Text.Encodings.GetEncodings()` will return whatever encodings are _currently available_ - whether just the default set by default or the _union_ of the default set and the additional encodings after provider registration.    As with the existing enumeration, the encodings (`EncodingInfo` instances) are returned in no guaranteed order.    If there is more than one registered provider that supports a given encoding, the returned list will contain only one entry for it.    ## Updates (most recent ones first)    * Clarification re returning only distinct encodings.  * Return  behavior clarified again - no particular enumeration order is guaranteed  * Made new `GetEncodings` method `virtual` rather than `abstract`.  * Open question removed in favor of unconditionally outputting all then-available encodings.  * Return behavior clarified (ordering).
28943	area-System.Net	Add more logging to SocketsHttpHandler	As part of looking at the usability of .NET Core network logging (compared to  .NET Framework), I did a walkthru of the current logging in SocketsHttpHandler.  I noticed some inconsistencies in how the NetEventSource logging is being used.    For the 2.1 release, I wanted to at least add more logging to some key areas  including places where we ignore errors/exceptions.    There is still more work to do to improve the logging to make it useful for  developers. This includes doing a better job at logging for System.Net.Sockets  as well as looking into other tool options besides PerfView to look at the traces.    I also fixed the sample script for using starting the traces using Windows logman.  The default log buffer size is too small even for for simple traces. Now, using PerfView  on all the System.Net.* traces no longer shows an error about traces being dropped.

28941	area-System.Net	HttpWebResponse.LastModified no longer throws 	"Discovered during the work for #28843    (System.Net.Request) [`HttpWebResponse.LastModified`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Requests/src/System/Net/HttpWebResponse.cs#L143-L157) no longer throws `ProtocolViolationException`:    ```csharp  public DateTime LastModified  {      get      {          CheckDisposed();          string lastmodHeaderValue = Headers[""Last-Modified""];          if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(lastmodHeaderValue))          {              return DateTime.Now;          }          DateTime dtOut;          HttpDateParse.ParseHttpDate(lastmodHeaderValue, out dtOut);          return dtOut;      }  }  ```    It looks like this occurred during the port, as [the file containing the original code was split](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/net/System/Net/Internal.cs,1975), and the code throwing the exception didn't make it.  Contrast this with `HttpWebRequest.IfModifiedSince`/`Date`, [where the exception did make it through](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/commit/9090df761a1a067c869e43066ba32fd39a26f516#diff-c70c98d319d6fa28c754b26a04324f2eR1444)    cc @davidsh "
28936	area-Infrastructure	Add WebAssembly build architecture	Adds a WebAssembly build architecture (and matching OS) based on using the Emscripten SDK. For the most part, this flavor is similar to Unix (but can be built by any OS). While the current changes are focused on the CoreRT WebAssembly implementation, they will most likely be useful for Mono as well.    This change includes:  * Adding the ```wasm``` architecture and ```WebAssembly``` OS  * Changes to run emscripten for wasm on Windows (building on Mac/Linux can be done in a future change). This also includes compensating for emscripten's tendency to return true for check_function_exists for functions it doesn't actually have.  * Fixes for building System.Native (other native libraries are disabled for now as they have larger dependencies that may not map as well)    The managed build doesn't work yet as contracts need to target the .NET Native System.Private.Corelib, but breaking changes in the Memory class prevent them from compiling.     Fixes #26107  
28935	area-System.Runtime	Add Time value type in System	# Rationale  Today, we have a `DateTime` struct in System that represents a specific date and time, which supports time zones. We also have a `TimeSpan` object that represents a duration (for example the time between two `DateTime`). I feel that we are missing a simple `Time` object that represents a time of day, without it being linked to a particular day.    There are a lot of reasons for representing time without dates. Alarms of an alarm clock, work shifts in a company, etc. T-Sql has a [time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/time-transact-sql) type that cannot today be mapped to a type in .Net.    `DateTime.TimeOfDay` today returns a  `TimeSpan`, but it feels out of place, `TimeSpan` represents a duration and not a specific time of day.    ## Implementation    Implementation would be pretty simple, it would have properties Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds, Ticks and a few comparison / transformation methods.    `DateTime.TimeOfDay` would return this new `Time` struct instead of the current `TimeSpan`.
28934	area-System.Net	Some problems in ping API	Related https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/9350    In PowerShell repo we port [TestConnection cmdlet](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/TestConnectionCommand.cs) and catch some problems in the ping API.    The problems documented in the [cmdlet tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Test-Connection.Tests.ps1) - see comments and `if (!isWindows)` blocks.    Below short list:    1. Dontfragment doesn't work on Unixes  This definitely should work on Linux and on [MacOs too](http://www.hackaapl.com/mazimum-transmission-unit-mtu-frame-size-in-os-x/)  2. `PingReply.Buffer` is empty on Unix. Expected - a buffer we send.  3. Ping unreachable host returns ErrorCode 6  (Handle is invalid) on Unix. Expected (as on Windows) - 11001 (Host not found).  4. API always returns Options based on default PingOptions() constructor (Ttl=128, DontFragment = false).  PingReply.Options.DontFragment:  - on Windows always returns false. Expected - real value from ping request.  - on Unix always returns null. Expected - real value from ping request (or false if not implemented).    PingReply.Options.Ttl - always 128.  Expected - real value from ping request.  PingReply.Options.Status - always Success (if we expect 'TtlExpired'). Expected - real status.    5. PingReply doesn't return ScopeId in IPAddress     
28933	area-System.Globalization	Add GetISOWeekOfYear()	## Rationale    .Net don't implement [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar) - it have alternative scheme in:  ```c#  System.Globalization.Calendar.GetWeekOfYear(DateTime time, CalendarWeekRule rule, DayOfWeek firstDayOfWeek);  ```    Unix `date` utility implements ISO 8601:  ```  date +%V  ```    In [PowerShell repo ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6542) we use workaround described [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/shawnste/2006/01/24/iso-8601-week-of-year-format-in-microsoft-net/) (see Keno's comment) for:  ```powershell  Get-Date -UFormat %V  ```    .Net should have parity and native implementation.    ISO 8601 is culture-independent so we can use static methods.    If we are going in the direction I believe it make sense consider all ISO8601 objects and compatibility with Unix `date` utility.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar  - first week  - last week  - weeks per year    http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html  - `%g` last two digits of year of ISO week number (see %G)  - `%G` year of ISO week number (see %V); normally useful only with %V  - `%V` ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)    ### Proposed API    ```c#    namespace System.Globalization  {      public abstract class Calendar : ICloneable      {          public static class ISO           {              // All ISO 8601 objects   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar)              public static int GetWeekOfYear(DateTime time);              public static int GetFirstWeekOfYear(DateTime time);              public static int GetLastWeekOfYear(DateTime time);              public static int GetWeeksPerYear(DateTime time);                     // Compatibility with Unix date utility (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html)               // %G year of ISO week number (see %V); normally useful only with %V              public static int GetYearOfWeek(DateTime time);      }  }    ```    Please note that the proposed API is a static and not instance member. The reason is ISO week is culture and calendar independent.    ### Alternative Design    ```C#  namespace System.Globalization  {      public abstract class Calendar : ICloneable      {          // All ISO 8601 objects   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar)          public static int GetISOWeekOfYear(DateTime time);          public static int GetISOFirstWeekOfYear(DateTime time);          public static int GetISOLastWeekOfYear(DateTime time);          public static int GetISOWeeksPerYear(DateTime time);            // Compatibility with Unix date utility (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html)            // %G year of ISO week number (see %V); normally useful only with %V          public static int GetISOYearOfISOWeek(DateTime time);      }  }    ```

28931	area-System.Net	Fix regression on OpenSsl exception message	Managed code relies on SSL error queue to give proper error information. PAL layer was clearing up the error queue and the exception messages were not precise.    This changes returns to the state before in which the managed side was in charge of cleaning up the queue (basically we care only about the last error). Perhaps in the future we should look in changing the PAL signature and doing all at once in the same place, but, as it is the fix gets us to where we were before.    Removing the error queue clean up is not a concern in light of the investigation of #25676 and as it is the managed will clean up the queue whenever necessary.    Fixes #28365    (Separating this PR from the one for #25676 since that one can take more time, but it will have the same fix and I've been testing it on the PR already).

Is there no way to enumerate these additional encodings?    Unfortunately, [`System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.codepagesencodingprovider.instance?view=netcore-2.0#System_Text_CodePagesEncodingProvider_Instance) lacks a method for enumerating them.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t perform well for scenarios where we want to keep memory usage to a minimum. System.Diagnostics.Tracing has the advantage of being part of the .NET BCL but we’ve observed intermittent exceptions and unexpected behavior in the past. Additionally, it suffers from the same memory consumption issue that TraceEvent does.  > In response to these challenges, Office 365 Security chose to implement our own API with three primary goals:  > •Intuitive and flexible API  > •High performance – filtering events in the native layer  > •Available both in .NET and native C++  > The result of this work is krabsetw, a library we’ve open-sourced under the MIT license. It contains both a native C++ API as well as a .NET API. This library is used in production today across Office 365 workloads on more than 100,000 machines. With filtering, we’re able to process more than more than 500 billion events per day, generating more than 7TB of data per day across the machines.  >     Is this still true?.. It is written one year ago (May 9, 2017), and other API's have updates since.   I want to know what API I can depend on, if not now, at least in upcoming updates.

28911	area-System.Memory	Hover Text for Span<T>/Memory<T> in Visual Studio ignores 'Hexadecimal Display' setting.	Not sure if this is a Visual Studio bug (if so, not sure where to submit that) - but, this issue seems to be happening with at least `System.Memory.Span<T>` and `System.Memory.Memory<T>` from what I can tell.  (Might have to do with #27338 / #16450 ?)    When hovering over one of these objects in Visual Studio the hover text ignores the User's Setting of 'Hexadecimal Display' and always displays the size of the array segment in decimal format.    The attached photo has Visual Studio in 'Hexadecimal Display' with a normal `byte[]` ({byte[0x00010000]}) alongside a `Memory<byte>`'s hovertext ({Byte[1535]}).    I feel it's fairly common to work in this Hex mode when dealing with memory, and this not working the same could lead to issues, or overlooking bugs (which happened to me a couple times before I caught on).

28899	area-Infrastructure	System.Buffers: XML doc in NuGet package (version 4.4.0 and later) differs from source code XML doc	**TL;DR:** Something appears to be wrong with the XML documentation included in the `System.Buffers` NuGet package, versions 4.4.0 and later. (4.4.0-preview2-25405-01 and earlier appear to have been fine*.) It doesn't match the XML documentation in the source code files.    ----    I was reading the documentation for parameter `clearArray` of the method `ArrayPool<T>.Return(T[] array, bool clearArray)`. It goes as follows (formatting and emphasis by me):    > Indicates whether the contents of the buffer should be cleared before reuse. **If bufferLength is set to true** [...]. **If bufferLength is set to false** [...].    The reference to `bufferLength` doesn't make any sense. There's nothing public called `bufferLength` in this class. Here's a screenshot of the documentation showing the same text:    ![XML documentation for `ArrayPool<T>.Return` as seen in Visual Studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104481/38443926-af5ca6f0-39ed-11e8-828b-8a725cacdc87.png)    Note that I'm using the latest package version, `4.5.0-preview1-26216-02`. The file `C:\Users\stakx\.nuget\packages\system.buffers\4.5.0-preview1-26216-02\version.txt` contains the hash `00490982c7952e96a1089818467caa6fd07541b2`, which I assume is a SHA-1 commit hash in this project's Git repository. Looking at that commit's version of `ArrayPool.cs`, this is what the documentation should read:    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/00490982c7952e96a1089818467caa6fd07541b2/src/System.Buffers/src/System/Buffers/ArrayPool.cs#L103-L108    No mention of `bufferLength` here, and this is the XML documentation you get with `System.Buffers` before version 4.4.0.    Looking at the version history of that file, there was never any `bufferLength` bit here as far as I can tell.    So what went wrong with the XML documentation starting with package version 4.4.0? Where does the `bufferLength` bit come from?    ----    **(*)** XML docs in package versions before 4.4.0 were fine only in the sense that the documentation matched with that from the source code... but there were other, probably unrelated problems: The XML documentation file was either named incorrectly (just `.xml`) or missing (not in the `lib\` directory, but in the `ref\` directory), so one wouldn't get any documentation in VS IntelliSense.
28898	area-System.Net	HttpClient.GetAsync/PostAsync sets different error code on SocketException on Windows 7 when host could not be resolved	"On all platforms except Windows 7 when host name could not be resolved we get `HttpRequestException` with inner `SocketException` with `SocketException.SocketErrorCode` set to `SocketError.HostNotFound` while on Windows 7 we get `SocketErrorCode.NoData`.

Might just be the way I run the multiple threads test, but still, if someone could confirm the behavior?    In theory in the following test the time difference between ""Enter"" log and ""Wait"" log should be very small, but as explained when I run it (with a lot of threads) I get large difference, like 10 seconds.    ```  static SemaphoreSlim s = new SemaphoreSlim(1, 1);    static void Test(object x)          {              Console.Write(""Enter"" + x + "" "" + System.DateTime.Now + ""\n"");              bool b = s.Wait(0);              Console.Write(""Wait"" + x + "" "" + System.DateTime.Now + ""\n"");              if (b)              {                  try                  {                      Console.Write(b + "" "" + x + ""\n"");                      for (long i = 1; i <= 5000000000; i++) {                          //                      }                  }                  finally                  {                      Console.Write(""Exit"" + x + "" "" + System.DateTime.Now + ""\n"");                      s.Release();                  }              } else {                  Console.Write(b + "" "" + x + ""\n"");                  Console.Write(""Exit False "" + x + "" "" + System.DateTime.Now + ""\n"");              }          }  ```    Thank you for your time.

28862	area-System.Security	[WIP] *NO MERGE* Mitigate the known case of missing SSL error clean up	[EDIT to reflect current content of PR]    *NO MERGE* I will be using this PR to run CI but will separate the product changes on their own PR.    This PR covers the following:    1. Fixes locations that were leaving errors on the SSL error queue:    1.1. Calls to SslShutdown in [src/Common/src/Interop/Unix/System.Security.Cryptography.Native/Interop.Ssl.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/28862/files#diff-f0513c093f14a9bf143efbacf9e57c47)    1.2. Calls to X509StoreAddCrl in [src/System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates/src/Internal/Cryptography/Pal.Unix/CrlCache.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/28862/files#diff-b5488457ea972ce8d66f60d2e319d9b9)    1.3. Calls to MultiDestroy and MultiRemoveHandle for CurlHandler were calling SSL_shutdown, cleaned up the SSL error queue after those calls  2. Separate the tests of PlatformHandler and SocketsHttpHandler because there is some indication that the former can leave errors in the SSL error queue, this is also in line with what our customers will be using (either PlatformHandler or SocketsHttpHandler, not both on the same process). There is no actual change to test sources.  3. Add custom build variable to help find other issues in which the SSL error queue is not being cleared. This is to be used locally at this point.    Some follow-up still required that are not part of this review yet:  * Add a config setting to turn the optimization on/off  * Keep investigating the possible workarounds (e.g.: [interpret error](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/28862/commits/f565614ce0d9f3cb76b99d2d64b5211ce8063585#diff-8e59f86b12ee01ddf687a1e3c5c34dbdR248))    Fixes #25676

28859	area-System.Net	Fix perf hit from WinHttpGetProxyForUrl	This PR optimizes some scenarios which we need to call `WinHttpGetProxyForUrl`.    1. Introduce the `WinHttpDetectAutoProxyConfigUrl` function, which implements a subset of the WPAD protocol: it attempts to auto-detect the URL for the proxy auto-config file, without downloading or executing the PAC file.    - If not able to find the script location. It is possible that there is no proxy auto-configuration file because the client has a direct Internet connection, and does not need a proxy server. Or a proxy server may be required, but the local network may not support WPAD. In both cases, the proxy configuration has to be obtained from the user or found somewhere on the client machine. We will use the information from calling into `WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser` to see whether a proxy server is listed in Internet Explorer's settings. Cache the information.    - If able to find the script location, the AutoDetect setting has precedence over the other settings. So if there is already a automatic configuration script location (from `WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser`), this value will be overridden. We will cache the related information and provide it to `WinHttpGetProxyForUrl`.    2. If there is no proxy, the information has been cached from the above procedures, we will stop calling into `WinHttpGetProxyForUrl`.    We have exhaustive test cases verifying behaviors with different proxy settings. Please let me know if there are special cases we care about, and I will add tests for them.    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/85062446c4e5af0c205f646e0ae720e160b20e85/src/System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler/tests/UnitTests/WinHttpHandlerTest.cs#L641-L832    Fix: #28543

28848	area-System.Collections	[Proposal] Use Bitmapped Vector Tries for ImmutableList	I'm wondering why aren't we using bitmapped Vector Tries for ImmutableList? Forgive me if this question has been asked.    As far as I know, this data structure is used in Closure's PersistentVector, and ImmutableJS's List. I have a preliminary implementation and it shows that it's faster than the current implementation of the current ImmutableList. For getting sequential or random elements in the list, the trie is about 4 times faster, and for adding elements, it about 3 times faster. Of course, these numbers are the preliminary findings.    For those who don't know what Bitmapped Vector Tries is:  [Understanding Clojure's Persistent Vectors](https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1)  [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)

Note, that on Windows  this works only for NTLM and NEGOTIATE as there is no way how to extract clear text password for  Basic or Digest authentication.    On Unix, there is typically not centralized identity management nor strong cryptographic ID.    However when Kerberos is configured, curl is able to use default principal from ticket if user previously authenticated using kinit.      > build@toweinfu-ubu17:~/github/corefx/src$ klist  > Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000  > Default principal: testuser@TEST.NET  >   > Valid starting       Expires              Service principal  > 04/05/2018 06:12:30  04/05/2018 16:12:30  krbtgt/TEST.NET@TEST.NET  >  renew until 04/06/2018 06:12:24  >     This does not work neither for CurlHandler nor for SocketsHttpHandler.    Further more, ,many Unix utilities (wget, curl, git, ftp, ...) can read credentials from .netrc file.  That is not great but it is still better than hardcoding secrets in code or passing them via environmental variable. If we choose to, this could be also source of default credentials (basic support tracked by #23313)

28843	area-System.Net	Consolidate http date parsing	"Fixes #12513  Followup to #28541     Fixes the following bugs for Http date parsing in System.Net.Requests:   - considered ANSI dates to be local (to the _receiver_, no less), instead of UTC/GMT like the spec says.   - accepted offset values (ie, `+05:00`), but didn't actually use them.   - would throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if a string token didn't have enough distinguishing characters (ie, `'S'` throws, because it needs to check the next character for `'a'`/`'u'` for Saturday/Sunday)   - would throw `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` for dates like `""Sun, 31 Nov 2018 16:33:01 GMT""` (there are only 30 days in November).    For System.Net.Requests, with respect to the original behavior:  - Retains case insensitivity of the original (mostly - UTC/GMT must now be uppercase).  - Drops ability to use partially matching day-of-week/month strings (ie, the original parses `""Surprise""` as `""Sunday""`).  - Drops ability to use non-matching date/day-of-week strings (ie `""Sat, 25 Mar 2018 16:33:01 GMT""` - the 25th was actually a Sunday)  - Drops ability to use arbitrary characters as separators.  - Now allows arbitrary amounts of whitespace between tokens.    cc: @stephentoub @geoffkizer @karelz @rmkerr @davidsh @caesar1995 @wfurt "
28842	area-System.Net	Enable connection pooling for requests that use different client certificates…	Enable connection pooling for requests that use different client certificates or server certificate callbacks. This allows setting these options on a per-request basis, which has much better perf for scenarios that want to share a session between requests that use different options for these.    #28841 
28841	area-System.Net	WinHttpHandler perf optimization for ClientCertificates, ServerCertificateValidationCallback	In a larger server app, there may be scenarios where different parts of the code need to use different client certificates on a per-request basis. Same with ServerCertificateValidationCallback. The native WinHttp library lets you efficiently pool connections across a session, and set client certificates and perform custom certificate validation on a per-request basis within that session, but the managed library forces you to share these settings across all requests in a session. People often use ServerCertificateValidationCallback as an instance delegate on some object that has a much shorter lifetime than the session.    It would be good if the managed library just let you set these on a per-request basis. It's really hard to get good perf otherwise.

This is an example of the errors one might get when hitting this issue:  ```  System.IO.FileNotFoundException occurred HResult=0x80070002  Message=Could not load file or assembly 'System.Net.Http, Version=4.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.  ```    One other symptom of this is that your project will complain that it needs some binding redirects added to your web.config, which you will have to add by double-clicking the warning from the error list in VS.    The reason behind what is happening is that because of [this known issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/514195-Targeting%20.NET%20Framework%204.7.1%20copies%20extra%20files%20to%20your%20bin%20directory.md) we end up requiring a few extra assemblies to be loaded in order to be able to run a .NET Standard-based component on .NET Framework. Because of how ASP.NET handles deployments, in some scenarios these extra files won't be copied over to the application directory, causing most of the issues.    This issue is created so that we can track the problem separate from issue #25773 as it was dicussed on this comment: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/25773#issuecomment-378341475    cc: @AlexGhiondea

I also executed the `top` and `htop` commands before generating this dump. Here's what it looked like:    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4930754/38312090-d7f8f8b2-37ee-11e8-92c2-934c68a3a9f5.png)    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4930754/38312094-db905862-37ee-11e8-8803-aa97e52f8c5c.png)    If I understand properly the output of `top`, the application uses about 1.47 GB of memory.

I ran the VS 2017 updater and freshly cloned master, then ran the sync script.    Cmake 3.11.0 was installed and I verified that its bin directory is listed when running the PATH command. Yet, there is an error `CMake is a pre-requisite to build this repository but it was not found on the path. Please install CMake...` followed by `Failed to generate native component build project!

That change left  the ""data too small"" error up to the individual provider libraries.    Windows reported NTE_BAD_DATA (""Bad data."") except for when it reported  ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (""The parameter is incorrect."")    macOS reported an AppleCryptographicException wrapping a CFError whose  message had a CSSM error const complaining about the size.    Linux (RSAOpenSsl) just tried the decryption and reported a padding failure,  except for when the padding worked out and it returned... something.    With this change all platforms will reject incorrectly sized data with a unified  string.  The data is now reported as not valid for the size of the key whether it  was too big or too small, and now reports consistently across the different  platforms and providers.    Fixes #28625."

28792	area-System.Linq	Enable faster invoke in interpreter	The change follows up on several TODOs and commented out unfinished implementation.    In cases where it is possible, we can avoid expensive calls via reflection and use more efficient delegate-based thunks. These are also the most common scenarios.   When optimized invocations are not possible (too many arguments, byref arguments, etc..) we still use reflection.    For the cases where we create thunks, there are small caches to hold the recently used ones - just to opportunistically avoid costs of creating thunk delegates again. That is particularly important when the thunks are created via Ref.Emit.    - [x] enable fast invoke pass  - [x] enable caching on reverse invoke (at the entry points to the interpreter lambdas)  - [x] enable fast invoker creation      
28791	area-System.IO	NamedPipeClientStream.Connect(int) does not respect timeout on UNIX domain sockets	On Windows, if you connect to a `NamedPipeServerStream` that was created with `maxNumberOfServerInstances=1` from one process, and attempt to connect to it from another process with `NamedPipeClientStream.Connect(timeout: 0)`, it throws.    On .NET Core 2.1 on Linux, the call to `Connect` hangs indefinitely instead. Internally, it's successfully called `connect()` and is waiting on `recvmsg()`.    Repro project:   [dotnet-pipe-server.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1873538/dotnet-pipe-server.zip)    On running `repro.sh`, you should get a stack dump from the second client process, since I didn't handle any exceptions from `Connect`. But instead it just waits. Doing the equivalent manually on Windows does throw, just like full framework .NET.

However, in .NET Core 2.0 and earlier, HttpClientHandler would enable them, due to being a wrapper for WinHTTP, which enabled them.  Both for compatibility and because we prefer those higher protocols whenever possible, SocketsHttpHandler also pretends they're part of the default when running on Win7/2008R2.

28770	area-System.Net	Fix ProxyExplicitlyProvided_DefaultCredentials_Ignored test	I couldn't get it to fail locally, but I believe the issue was that sporadically WinHttpHandler would not reuse the original connection, in which case it would either not close the first and the test would hang (and then the client would timeout) because nothing was accepting the second connection, or it would close the first and fail because the server was expecting a second request on the connection.  This fixes it by using Connection: close on the first response so that the client won't reuse the same connection.

It looks like there is a lot of API overhead and comparatively little work actually parsing the network protocol. The console process uses 100% of one CPU core. SQL Server uses only about 1/3 of one CPU core. This is further (heuristic) evidence that the client is less efficient than the server.    There is no way to avoid this cost at the moment. The code is as fast as it gets. **I suggest the following enhancement**: Provide an API that directly deserializes into a user-provided type.    Old:  ```  IDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();  while (reader.MoveNext()) {   //Read all fields individually  }  ```    New:  ```  IEnumerable<MyDTO> resultRows = command.ExecuteObjects<MyDTO>();  ```    This API could be made extremely fast because:    * It is less chatty. ADO.NET can access it's internal buffers more directly.  * Metadata overhead has to be incurred only once for the whole result set. Many per-row and per-field metadata accesses and validations can be eliminated.  * ADO.NET can compile a lambda expression dynamically that pulls data from the internal byte buffers and pushes it into the user-provided type. To illustrate the point: The expression could look like this: `new MyDTO() { Field1 = internalReader.GetNextFieldAsInt32(), Field2 = internalReader.GetNextFieldAsString(), ... }`.  * The lambda can be cached internally. Alternatively an API consumer would use a factory to create a ""fast reader"" and cache the reader.  * The entire row can be read in one go. I believe this makes it faster to parse the TDS protocol.  * If async is in use there will be less async overhead because the APIs are less chatty.    <hr>    Possible extensions of this idea would be:    * Allow structs as well as classes  * Allow invoking a constructor  * Allow sequences of the form `IEnumerable<object[]>` where all field values are provided as objects.   * Add a pull-style API. Very rough API idea: `readerObject.GetNextObject<MyDTO>()`.  * Add a way to provide and reuse preallocated objects e.g. `readerObject.GetNextObject<MyDTO>(existingObject)`.  * Async support (`IAsyncEnumerable` or other suitable mechanisms).  * Maybe there can be a parallel mode that hands our a `ParallelQuery`. I'm *not* optimistic this can be done.  * Allow sequences of the form `IEnumerable<MyDTO[]>`. Here, ADO.NET would hand out rows in chunks. The chunk size would be chosen optimally. Probably, ADO.NET would convert each network buffer into a chunk. This would make the API even less chatty.    I understand that this proposal is a bit raw. The API that I proposed is a straw man that clearly has some flaws. I think an API in this spirit could improve efficiency a lot. It also would be very convenient. The existing pattern is extremely awkward to use. People are using light-weight wrappers like Dapper which look just like this API proposal.    <hr>    The API should be so that ORMs such as Entity Framework can use it as well. This might not be trivial depending on what Entity Framework does. Here's an idea on how to support arbitrary object instantiation:    Instead of making ADO.NET figure out how to construct the `new MyDTO()...` part of the expression tree, let the user provide that. ADO.NET provides one `Expression` for each field to be deserialized. It could look like this:    ```  var fastReader = FastReader.Create<MyDTO>(      columnDescriptions /* contains the type and order of columns */,      (Expression[] columnValueExpressions) =>          Expression.New(typeof(MyDTO), columnValueExpressions) //Create new MyDTO(...) expression  });    //cache fastReader    IEnumerable<MyDTO> objects = fastReader.Read(mySqlDataReader);  ```    In this example, the API caller can create an arbitrary deserialization expression that uses the ADO.NET provided column values in `columnValueExpressions`. `columnValueExpressions[0]` would correspond to `internalReader.GetNextFieldAsInt32()` in the code further above. Entity Framework could construct an expression tree that does anything it wants including creating multiple objects, calling factory methods and calling into the object state manager. All of this processing would be very close to obtaining the actual column values from internal ADO.NET data structures. No chattyness.    "

28767	area-System.Net	Stop artificially rooting SocketAsyncEventArgs	SocketAsyncEventArgs creates an overlapped object that references the SAEA.  That overlapped object creates an async pinning handle in the runtime, which roots the SocketAsyncEventArgs.  The cycle from SAEA->Overlapped->handle->SAEA involving the root means that a dropped SAEA that's not Dispose'd will end up leaking.    This commit fixes that by adding a level of indirection between the handle and the SAEA.  Rather than wrapping the SAEA directly, the handle is given an intermediate object that references the SAEA, and the SAEA then stores itself as a reference into that object only while an active operation is in progress.  Once the operation completes, the reference in that object is nulled out, and the SAEA will no longer be kept alive by the pinning handle.

A common usage is checking `Memory.Length` (as `.Length` isn't exposed up stream via `IMemoryOwner`) so if overriding `.Length` were the path chosen; then that's an interface call to `Memory`, which then makes a virtual call to `.Length`(then the Memory .ctor makes a further 2 virtual calls to `.Length` O_o) so its a bad path anyway.    Overriding `Memory` with this change on the other hand is would be a single interface call; then you're done, so its the better path.    e.g. the second should be chosen over the first below for performance in its common usage pattern  ```diff  public class OwnedArray<T> : MemoryManager<T>  {      T[] _array;      int _referenceCount;        -   public override int Length => _array.Length;  +   public override Memory<T> Memory => CreateMemory(_array.Length)  ```    Additionally currently there is the confusion of which choice to make of the two properties to override. The `Memory` override also provide greater utility as the `offset` can be changed.    cc @GrabYourPitchforks, @davidfowl, @pakrym, @davidfowl @KrzysztofCwalina 
28750	area-System.Memory	Should we provide direct ReadOnlySequence constructors for MemoryManager?	Early ReadOnlySequence has constructors to create it with OwnedMemory. Now OwnedMemory is replaced by MemoryManager and constructors was removed.    Now it is possible to create ReadOnlySequence with MemoryManager by using MemoryManager.Memory property. But it seems strange that we convert MemoryManager to ReadOnlyMemory and then ReadOnlySequence convert it back to MemoryManager by using marshaling.    Should we provide direct ReadOnlySequence constructors for MemoryManager as it was for OwnedMemory?

Repro:  ```C#  using System;  using System.Net;  using System.Net.Sockets;  using System.Threading;    class Program  {      static void Main()      {          for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) DoWork();          Console.WriteLine(""Waiting for finalizers..."");          while (true)          {              GC.Collect();              GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();          }      }        static void DoWork()      {          var d = new DerivedSocketAsyncEventArgs();          using (Socket listener = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp))          {              listener.Bind(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 0));              listener.Listen(1);                using (Socket client = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp))              {                  d.RemoteEndPoint = listener.LocalEndPoint;                  var mres = new ManualResetEventSlim();                  d.Completed += (s, e) => mres.Set();                  if (client.ConnectAsync(d)) mres.Wait(); // Uncomment this line to see finalizers run              }          }      }  }    class DerivedSocketAsyncEventArgs : SocketAsyncEventArgs  {      ~DerivedSocketAsyncEventArgs() => Console.WriteLine(""finalized"");  }  ```"

28739	area-System.Text	Speed up regex FindFirstChar when there are exactly 2 possible match start characters	"Regex-Redux spends much of its time scanning its huge input string to find the first character of a match ([see perf analysis here](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27124) - this is the 20% or more time noted in CharInClassInternal)    This scan is the job of FindFirstChar(). In general character classes are complicated objects because they must store possibly several valid ranges, which may be character classes, as well as some options such as negating. They are packed objects and a binary search is used to check whether a candidate character matches the class. See http://www.moserware.com/2009/03/how-net-regular-expressions-really-work.html for a breakdown of how they work.    We do some optimizations to avoid this binary search for every character. First is Boyer-Moore which helps for long fixed prefix. Second is [IsSingleton](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Text.RegularExpressions/src/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexInterpreter.cs#L420), which special cases for positive match of a single specific character.    RegexRedux doesn't benefit much from either of these. It has no long prefix and in many cases there are several possible first characters. For example [here](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Text.RegularExpressions/tests/Performance/Perf.RegexRedux.cs#L56) in `""agggt[cgt]aa|tt[acg]accct""` much of the time it is scanning for either `a` or `t`. In some cases there are some more options for example in `""agggtaa[cgt]|[acg]ttaccct""` it would start looking for `a`, `c` or `g` to begin the match. However two characters is the key case.    At this point we are looking for localized low risk changes.    Firstly I made a small speedup to the binary search by replacing `(min + max) / 2` with ` (min & max) + ((min ^ max) >> 1)` (apparently from Knuth .. it can be intuitively seen that halving the sum will retain all the bits they have in common, and half of all the bits they do not have in common). It is nice that it avoids overflow but that is not relevant in this case. This gave only a small improvement: I measured ~1% on an artificial test case and within noise on the full test. Nevertheless it is low harm so I retained it and used it in the other two binary searches in the file.    Secondly I special cased the ""two possible characters"" as IsDoubleton in the same pattern as existing IsSingleton. This gave a larger benefit, with no measureable hit on the generic test case:    ## before  two runs:      System.Text.RegularExpressions.Performance.Tests.dll                               | Metric         | Unit  | Iterations |    Average |   STDEV.S |        Min |        Max    :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------- |:-----:|:----------:| ----------:| ---------:| ----------:| ----------:     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | Duration       | msec  |     44     |    229.951 |    11.146 |    219.932 |    258.559     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | GC Allocations | bytes |     44     | 1.871E+008 | 48478.158 | 1.870E+008 | 1.872E+008     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: Compiled) | Duration       | msec  |     27     |    377.521 |    20.081 |    335.727 |    419.947     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: None)     | Duration       | msec  |     15     |    709.439 |    31.986 |    655.717 |    765.097         System.Text.RegularExpressions.Performance.Tests.dll                              | Metric         | Unit  | Iterations |    Average |   STDEV.S |        Min |        Max    :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------- |:-----:|:----------:| ----------:| ---------:| ----------:| ----------:     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | Duration       | msec  |     45     |    226.408 |    13.236 |    212.146 |    262.963     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | GC Allocations | bytes |     45     | 1.871E+008 | 46358.265 | 1.869E+008 | 1.872E+008     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: Compiled) | Duration       | msec  |     28     |    366.970 |    17.217 |    337.323 |    407.299     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: None)     | Duration       | msec  |     15     |    700.781 |    35.247 |    653.294 |    790.779    ## after  two runs:      System.Text.RegularExpressions.Performance.Tests.dll                              | Metric         | Unit  | Iterations |    Average |   STDEV.S |        Min |        Max    :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------- |:-----:|:----------:| ----------:| ---------:| ----------:| ----------:     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | Duration       | msec  |     46     |    220.359 |     7.715 |    213.496 |    247.767     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | GC Allocations | bytes |     46     | 1.871E+008 | 48166.588 | 1.870E+008 | 1.872E+008     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: Compiled) | Duration       | msec  |     29     |    345.858 |    22.669 |    318.472 |    412.110     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: None)     | Duration       | msec  |     15     |    667.597 |    33.483 |    624.545 |    745.706      System.Text.RegularExpressions.Performance.Tests.dll                              | Metric         | Unit  | Iterations |    Average |   STDEV.S |        Min |        Max    :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------- |:-----:|:----------:| ----------:| ---------:| ----------:| ----------:     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | Duration       | msec  |     45     |    226.161 |    15.460 |    212.438 |    300.492     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.Perf_Regex.Match                             | GC Allocations | bytes |     45     | 1.871E+008 | 59941.718 | 1.869E+008 | 1.872E+008     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: Compiled) | Duration       | msec  |     29     |    354.753 |    22.682 |    310.074 |    390.565     System.Text.RegularExpressions.Tests.RegexRedux.RegexReduxMini(options: None)     | Duration       | msec  |     15     |    666.738 |    30.583 |    621.243 |    709.226       The RegexReduxMini not compiled improves by 6% (a little better than 1 std dev).

At this point I only made the change in the interpreted mode. I annotated the relevant compiled mode code which demonstrates it is not a simple transliteration into IL. That is future work. Meantime I believe the risk of this change diverging behavior is low because it is an extension of existing singleton behavior.  "
28733	area-System.Net	Regression: HTTPS defaults to older TLS version for Win7	"On Win7/2008R2 the new SocketsHttpHandler uses older defaults for TLS versions than the WinHttpHandler it's replacing.

28724	area-System.Security	SslStream with CRL checking enabled throws CryptographicException on Linux upon upgrade of server certificates	"**Overview**  A Linux application speaking to a server using SslStream will no longer be able to connect if the server upgrades its certificates such that it contains a new CRL distribution point (e.g. a different URL). After this upgrade, SslStream will throw a CryptographicException (error code 44) from Internal.Cryptography.Pal.OpenSslX509ChainProcessor.MapVerifyErrorToChainStatus.  Error code 44 maps to X509_V_ERR_DIFFERENT_CRL_SCOPE (see https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/3bb0f989b53c59c6d4527a0b5077dbb7fabe14b7/include/openssl/x509_vfy.h#L144).    **Workaround**  Clearing the cached CRL at ~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/crls prior to the certificate upgrade will allow the application to connect without any downtime, assuming that the application doesn't reacquire another copy of the old CRL (e.g. due to a disconnect/reconnect). The filename will be the hashed issuer's name.  (see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/722d50c8957297009dbce771f3ea317cccf457be/src/System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates/src/Internal/Cryptography/Pal.Unix/CrlCache.cs#L139-L162)     **Hypothesis**  The exception is likely thrown because even though the new certificate specifies a new CRL distribution point, the issuer name has not changed, so the cache thinks it contains a valid CRL for the new certificate and does not download the new CRL even though the distribution point has changed.    However, when the interop library calls OpenSSL to verify the certificate stores, the error code 44 is generated and an exception is later thrown from Internal.Cryptography.Pal.OpenSslX509ChainProcessor.MapVerifyErrorToChainStatus.  I believe this error code is generated due to the mismatch between the cached CRL's distribution point and the distribution point specified in the new certificate.     **Possible fix**  Using the hash of the CRL distribution point string as the filename for the cached CRL should prevent this problem. However, I am uncertain if there are OpenSSL interop implications if a different filename is used for the cached CRL. There does seem to be precedent in OpenSSL for using the hash of the issuer name as the file name for cached copy of CRL (see https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/X509_LOOKUP_file.html)     **Reproduction**  Create a chain of certificates that mimics certificates issued by DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server CA. The final server certificates ""A"" and ""B"" should be issued for the same FQDN but with different distribution points (simulating an upgrade of the server certificate).     My apologies if these steps are already self-evident for those with more SSL experience, but these are the steps I used:     1. Create a self signed root CA such that ""X509v3 Key Usage: Digital Signature, Certificate Sign, CRL Sign"".  2. Generate a CRL for the root CA, taking care that the CRL does _not_ have a X509v3 Issuing Distribution Point (IDP).  3. Create an intermediate certificate authority with the same key usage as the root CA and with an X509v3 IDP pointing to the CRL generated in step 2.  4. Generate a CRL for the intermediate CA. This CRL should contain an X509v3 IDP.  5. Create the server certificate ""A"" signed by the intermediate CA. This certificate should have an X509v3 IDP that matches the IDP for the CRL generated in step 4.  6. Generate another CRL for the intermediate CA with a different filename from the one in (4). This CRL also should have an X509v3 IDP.  7. Create the server certificate ""B"", signed by the intermediate CA.  This certificate should have an X509v3 IDP that matches the IDP of the CRL generated in step 6.  8. Install the root CA by copying the certificate to its own directory under /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/, setting the permissions to 644, and running update-ca-certificates.   9. Host a test server using openssl s_server: ""openssl s_server -port 44330 -key keyA.pem -cert certA.pem -CAfile intermediatecert.pem"".  10. Create a test app that connects to the OpenSSL s_server using SslStream, calling AuthenticateAsClient with checkCertificateRevocation: true. After it connects successfully, bring down the test server and re-host it using B's certs and key. The test app should now throw the CryptographicException.

28716	area-System.Numerics	Make decimal API more complete (number of decimal digits, equality, negative zero)	"@GSPP commented on [Mon Apr 02 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/17378)  1. It is currently not possible to query the number of decimal digits in a decimal value. Note, that decimal can store trailing zeroes. 1m != 1.0m != 1.00m. There are methods to find out but they are nasty (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13477689/find-number-of-decimal-places-in-decimal-value-regardless-of-culture). A fundamental type such as decimal should make this easier. `GetBits` causes an expensive allocation.  2. All Framework provided decimal equality comparisons treat trailing zeros as irrelevant. All of the following are true: `1.0m == 1.00m`, `1.0m.Equals(1.00m)`, `1.0m.GetHashCode() == 1.00m.GetHashCode()`. This is correct but there also should be a way to compare while being sensitive to trailing zeroes. There need to be equality and hash code APIs observing trailing zeroes.  3. Be able to reflect over negative zero. There are multiple representations for zero in decimal (https://stackoverflow.com/a/3139783). `decimal.GetBits(0.0m) != decimal.GetBits(-0.0m)` and `-0.0m == 0.0m`. There should be an `IsNegative` property. Note, that `(-0.0m).ToString() == ""0.0""`. This means that the sign cannot even be found out from the string representation.  4. Maybe there should be more helper APIs around trailing zeroes. For example, an API to set the number of decimal places. This API would add or remove trailing zeroes. I believe the `Round` methods only remove but do not add zeroes.    These API requests are motivated by my work on a financial application. Different 3rd party data sources needed to be interpreted and combined in awkward ways.    Dealing with these issue should not be that hard. The internet is full of people trying to solve these various decimal issues. There should be obvious and simple framework methods. Using code from the web (Stack Overflow) to address any of this is very risky because the code might be faulty.    ---  @RussKeldorph commented on [Mon Apr 02 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/17378#issuecomment-377962550)  @danmosemsft   ---  @danmosemsft commented on [Mon Apr 02 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/17378#issuecomment-377974800)  @tannergooding any thoughts?  ---  @danmosemsft commented on [Mon Apr 02 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/17378#issuecomment-377974886)  Since this includes API requests. moving to corefx.

28707	area-System.Net	Investigate perf improvements to Uri for SocketsHttpHandler usage	For simple requests, SocketsHttpHandler ends up spending a fair amount of CPU retrieving info from Uri (e.g. Uri.IdnHost and similar).  This also causes a fair amount of allocation in some cases.    Ideally we could reduce both CPU and allocation by using `ReadOnlySpan<char>` to retrieve the info we need.  In common cases where no escaping/encoding is necessary, this should help significantly.

And if it is, what does it mean? Why doesn't the write method add the delimiter, and what are those too many delimiters added by the TraceError and TraceInformation methods?    By the way:  I suggest to add Write(string[]) and Write(object[]) overloads to write the array elements separated by the delimiter.  "

There is problem: ref return properties have `CanWrite` set to false preventing easy generation of assign expressions!    I use 4.7.1 Desktop framework for now with future plans to move to Core.    Is this by design or overlooked? Is there some hack around this issue?
28683	area-System.Security	ASN.1 Deserialize fails with SequenceOf strings	"Let me preface this with the statement that I fully understand this is an internal-only API (for now at least). Nevertheless, this is a fairly important test case.    Suppose an ASN.1 of    ```  kdc-req ::= SEQUENCE {  ...   sname [3] PrincipalName OPTIONAL,  ...  }    PrincipalName ::= SEQUENCE {   name-type [0] Int32,   name-string [1] SEQUENCE OF KerberosString  }    KerberosString  ::= GeneralString (IA5String)  ```    There are two issues here.    1. GeneralString is not actually supported. You cannot futz your way through by decorating the struct field to think it's an IA5String. I had to add a new attribute and modified the deserializer to treat it the same as IA5String.  2. SequenceOf GeneralString/IA5String cannot parse correctly *when there are multiple values in the sequence*.     It decodes the array as a struct and throws because there's extra data. There's no way it can move on to the next element in the sequence. Conversely, you can't coerce the deserializer to operate against string[] because it can't be a SequenceOf and GeneralizedString/IA5String at the same time.        ### Sample    This will throw when it finishes reading the first string of `sname`. It'll complete the pass over the struct fields, but there's more data in the sequence.    I think it would be helpful if you could decorate a `SequenceOf` as a specialized type, e.g. `GeneralizedString`.    ```c#  var asReq = ""3081d3a103020105a20302010aa31530133011a10402020080a20904073005a0030101ffa481af30""   + ""81aca00703050040810010a1153013a003020101a10c300a1b087374737966756873a2091b07524""   + ""5444d4f4e44a31c301aa003020102a11330111b066b72627467741b075245444d4f4e44a511180f3""   + ""2303337303931333032343830355aa611180f32303337303931333032343830355aa70502036875""   + ""0da81530130201120201110201170201180202ff79020103a91d301b3019a003020114a11204104""   + ""d494e494e542d364a49454842472020"";    var req = AsnSerializer.Deserialize<KdcReq>(StringToByteArray(asReq), AsnEncodingRules.DER);      [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]  public struct KdcReq  {      /*      AS-REQ          ::= [APPLICATION 10] KDC-REQ        TGS-REQ         ::= [APPLICATION 12] KDC-REQ                KDC-REQ         ::= SEQUENCE {          -- NOTE: first tag is [1], not [0]          pvno            [1] INTEGER (5) ,          msg-type        [2] INTEGER (10 -- AS -- | 12 -- TGS --),          padata          [3] SEQUENCE OF PA-DATA OPTIONAL                              -- NOTE: not empty --,          req-body        [4] KDC-REQ-BODY      }*/        [ExpectedTag(1, ExplicitTag = true)]      public int pvno;        [ExpectedTag(2, ExplicitTag = true)]      public int msgType;        [ExpectedTag(3, ExplicitTag = true)]      public PaData[] PaData;        [ExpectedTag(4, ExplicitTag = true)]      public KdcReqBody reqBody;  }    [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]  public struct PaData  {      // padata-type[1] Int32,      // padata-value[2] OCTET STRING -- might be encoded AP-REQ        [ExpectedTag(1, ExplicitTag = true)]      public int paDataType;        [ExpectedTag(2, ExplicitTag = true), OctetString]      public ReadOnlyMemory<byte> paDataValue;  }    [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]  public struct KdcReqBody  {      /*      kdc-options             [0] KDCOptions,      cname                   [1] PrincipalName OPTIONAL                                  -- Used only in AS-REQ --,      realm                   [2] Realm                                  -- Server's realm                                  -- Also client's in AS-REQ --,      sname                   [3] PrincipalName OPTIONAL,      from                    [4] KerberosTime OPTIONAL,      till                    [5] KerberosTime,      rtime                   [6] KerberosTime OPTIONAL,      nonce                   [7] UInt32,      etype                   [8] SEQUENCE OF Int32 -- EncryptionType                                  -- in preference order --,      addresses               [9] HostAddresses OPTIONAL,      enc-authorization-data  [10] EncryptedData OPTIONAL                                  -- AuthorizationData --,      additional-tickets      [11] SEQUENCE OF Ticket OPTIONAL                                      -- NOTE: not empty               */      [ExpectedTag(0, ExplicitTag = true), BitString]      public ReadOnlyMemory<byte> kdcOptions;        [ExpectedTag(1, ExplicitTag = true), OptionalValue]      public PrincipalName?

28679	area-System.Xml	Marking tests affected by 27740 in XmlSchemaValidatorApi as active issue	The root cause of #27740 does not seem to be in the tests themselves but in my Ubuntu VM the 2 tests hitting it are being disabled in this PR. Later I will provide the crashing stacks but I want to test the other exit code 134 before doing that.

28671	area-System.Net	Improve parsing of WinINet default proxy strings in SocketsHttpHandler 	"WinINet default proxy strings consist of a semicolon or whitespace separated list of proxies, each with the following format:  ```  ([<scheme>=][<scheme>""://""]<server>["":""<port>])  ```  For example:  ```  http=127.0.0.1:8888;https=127.0.0.1:8888  ```  Our current implementation can only handle a single proxy in the list, and expects that ""://"" will be used instead of ""="". This breaks proxies for users with valid proxy configurations, and applications that configure multiple default proxies (such as Fiddler). In making the fix I tried to write the code to make as few allocations as possible, since the default proxy is checked frequently. Let me know if I should go back to the easy to read fix involving String.Split :)    I made the following assumptions when writing this fix:  - SocketsHttpHandler only supports http proxies.  - When a user provides multiple proxies with the same scheme, we can choose to use the first.    This PR also significantly increases the number of test cases for the relevant code.    See #28603 for more info."

28664	area-Microsoft.CSharp	When a new binder is exactly the same as existing one, just use the old instance instead.	"When a new binder is exactly the same as existing one, just use the old instance instead.    The reason is that DLR associates L2 cache with binder instances. The older binder, while equivalent, may already have some bindings in its cache. It makes sense to reuse them. This is the whole point of L2 cache.  I.E. If the second callsite happens to bind the same operation (say a dynamic addition that turns out to be adding ints), it can simply reuse the results of the previous binding - as long as these ""+"" callsites use the same binder instance.    Dynamic binding is a relatively expensive reflection-heavy operation. It is nice to be able to reuse the results."

28657	area-System.Net	SslStream mutates state of Client/ServerAuthenticationOptions	Comment from @stephentoub in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/28278 has pointed to the issue we have in SslStream where we mutate Options object.    The problem with mutating the object is that sharing the same Options across different SslStream instance can cause races and make different than expected callback be called.    Examples of mutating state:  https://github.com/krwq/corefx/blob/705e95f02d179cccc6a290e5cf9f05fbd9873ed3/src/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslStream.cs#L252  https://github.com/krwq/corefx/blob/705e95f02d179cccc6a290e5cf9f05fbd9873ed3/src/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslStream.cs#L323  https://github.com/krwq/corefx/blob/705e95f02d179cccc6a290e5cf9f05fbd9873ed3/src/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslStream.cs#L360

28655	area-System.Linq	ParallelEnumerable.Aggregate XML documentation appears to be incorrect.	The [summary documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/a38c5000be0d4b98445ef43d642614d0e8d8f82d/src/System.Linq.Parallel/src/System/Linq/ParallelEnumerable.cs#L1655) for the `ParallelEnumerable.Aggregate` method says:     > Applies in parallel an accumulator function over a sequence.    The implementation, however, delegates to the `PerformSequentialAggregation` method, which applies the accumulator function sequentially.     Unless there is something I'm missing, the documentation is discrepant and would more accurately say this:     > Applies an accumulator function sequentially over a sequence.

Last night my machine was updated to 10.13.4, and now this morning when I run the project I get this error:    ```  An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.  System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'XXX'   threw an exception. ---> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: A connection   was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred   during the pre-login handshake. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 31 -   Encryption(ssl/tls) handshake failed) --->   System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException:   Error occurred during a cryptographic operation.  ```    Anyone else on 10.13.4 able to successfully connect to SQL Server this morning?
28650	area-System.Drawing	FontFamily.Equals in Linux use .Name instead of NativeFamily pointer which is not a singleton	Fixes: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28052    In linux FontFamily objects are not treated as singleton so their NativeFamily pointers can change from object to object. However, when getting the FontFamily.Name from the native pointer we would get the same value if the FontFamily is the same.     However since we depend on the different font families across operative systems and Linux distros, we can have results where 2 fonts in linux are part of the same font family and in windows they are part of different families.    cc: @danmosemsft @qmfrederik

28639	area-System.Net	Stop blocking explicit opt-in to old SslProtocols in SslStream and HttpClient	By default, .NET Core defaults to allowing TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2.  However, whereas .NET Framework allows a developer to opt-in to SSLv2/SSLv3, .NET Core currently blocks it.  This means developers are unable to use .NET Core when they need to communicate with an endpoint they don't control and that's unfortunately limited to one of these protocols, which blocks adoption of .NET Core.    This commit stops blocking these protocols.  They're still disabled by default, and compiling against them still results in a deprecation warning, but if a developer chooses to ignore the warning and explicitly sets SslProtocols, they are at least able to use the protocols, subject to whatever the underlying operating system allows (e.g. Windows stops supporting SSLv2 as of v1607).    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/15661  cc: @bartonjs, @GrabYourPitchforks, @davidsh  (Note I'm expecting when mission control comes back up I'll still have a handful of test failures to investigate.  I also should call out that some of the impacted tests are previously ActiveIssue'd, so as part of testing this I temporarily commented out the ActiveIssue, but I reverted that commenting for the PR.)
28638	area-System.Net	Some more allocation reduction in SocketsHttpHandler	- Pool SocketAsyncEventArgs used for establishing connections.  Today we create a new SocketAsyncEventArgs for each new connection, and it's used only for the ConnectAsync.  This establishes a bounded pool of them, such that they can be reused.  To do this, I moved the nested ConcurrentQueue.Segment type into a partial file so that we could use that directly, as it supports bounding (we can use it as a public type if/when https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24365 is addressed). FYI, @kouvel.    - Zero pool lifetimes. If the PooledConnectionIdleTimeout is zero or if the PooledConnectionLifetime is zero, then no connection will ever actually be usuable from the pool.  In such a situation we can a) avoid creating the cleaning timer, and b) dispose of the connection as it's being returned to the pool, rather than waiting for it to be scavenged.    - CookieContainer string allocation.  Its ctor is allocating a string that can instead be constructed once and used across all CookieContainers.    cc: @geoffkizer 
28637	area-System.Net	Fix race condition on read ahead task in SocketsHttpHandler	We're supposed to only use a ValueTask<int> once.  But there's a race condition where we may not only use one more than once, we might do so concurrently, resulting in a variety of different exceptions depending on how the race condition manifests.    When we take a connection out of the connection pool, we want to check whether it's still valid for use.  We could poll, but since the request/response is going to need to issue at least one read anyway, we just do so preemptively, then checking whether the read completed synchronously (if it did, we can't use the connection).  This gets stored in a field on the HttpConnection that can later be read.  However, we may also create the read ahead task in another situation, which is if we're unable to easily fish out the underlying socket used by the connection (as happens with tunneling), when the pool periodically scavenges and looks for dead connections, rather than polling it just issues that read even earlier.  Doing so, however, means that we'll have kicked off tasks that are likely to complete with an exception if the connection is terminated in an unfriendly manner.  To avoid such exceptions spamming TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException, we check this stored task when disposing the connection.    That, however, creates the race condition.  If the connection is disposed (e.g. due to cancellation) at just the wrong time, the request/response may be in the process of working with that initial read just as the disposal goes to interact with that same read ahead task.  Badness results.    The fix is to add a tiny amount of synchronization, such that just one call site can take ownership of the read ahead task.    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidfowl

A simple `git grep TDelegate` and `git grep TEnum` will display the majority of these APIs.

However, my team has run into a fundamental problem running .NET Core tests in Linux with en_us.POSIX locale. We have no issue with the en_us.UTF8 locale. For example, string.Compare() does not work properly in case-sensitive comparison.    - string.Compare(""C03DATE"", ""C03DATE"", true) return zero, which is expected  - string.Compare(""c03DATE"", ""C03DATE"", true) return non-zero, which is not expected because it is case-insensitive comparison.

28610	area-System.Net	Make it clear that the default proxy cannot by set via environment variable on Windows	This test was tagged with an active issue disabling it on Windows, but the behavior is actually by design.     Quoting @davidsh:  > The default for .NET Framework is to use WinINET-style (IE registry setttings) to find the default proxy. There has never been a concept for using environment variables on Windows. It might be an interesting idea to add environment variables which could override the WinINET-style proxy settings. But that seems like a new feature for .NET Core. We would want to have those variables be appropriately named. In some ways, this would provide the ability for easier machine-wide proxy settings which has been requested by users in the past. WinINET-style settings are only available for interactive user accounts on Windows, i.e. those accounts with those registry settings. Background service accounts like those used in NT-style services don't have those settings by default. So, adding environment variables might be a useful thing.    I agree that we should look into adding support for default proxies set via environment variable, but for now I think we should just make it clear this isn't a bug.    Fixes: #25640

28603	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler not debuggable	As I've been troubleshooting various issues with the new SocketsHttpHandler the largest barrier has been the lack of diagnostic visibility into what's going on while it processes requests.    There is a DiagnosticHandler, but it's a wrapper around SocketsHttpHandler, it doesn't give visibility into the internal operations or final output.  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/45fb8a627e727df337580291b45317ee5e66b5a5/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/HttpClientHandler.Windows.cs#L481    Nor does SocketsHttpHandler work with Fiddler. Is this an issue with auto-proxy detection? Or is there an issue with bypassing proxies on localhost? This is a significant development blocker. Being able to see the requests as they're emitted to the wire can help troubleshoot formatting issues, redirects, auth, etc.. The hoops I had to jump through to capture the output for https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28557 were excessive. Similar diagnostic deficiencies are hindering the evaluation of a new issue https://github.com/aspnet/HttpSysServer/issues/439.     With net4x HttpWebRequest by comparison I could enable full logging of every byte output to a Socket, before or after SSL, as well as HTTP level logs about overall protocol flow.    Microsoft Message Analyzer is the next best option for capturing localhost traffic, though their current installer appears to be broken, and it's less than ideal for SSL scenarios.    @karelz @geoffkizer

In that case, the  printer serves up a DEVMODE structure  whose ""dmFields"" flags indicate the absence  of those fields and thus, the meaningless property  does not get populated in the DEVMODE.    Given that    1. this is the existing NETFX behavior.    2. there's no other obvious value to put in these     properties when the printer doesn't support them.     Perhaps these properties should have been nullable     properties but that horse has long left the barn.    3. The purpose of the Hdevmode_IntPtr apis is not cloning     PrinterSettings (PrinterSettings explicitly supports     a Clone() method for that purpose.) The test is     just using it that way as a way of validating     the HDevMode_IntPtr apis in the best way it can     in a generic unit test run on uncontrolled     machines.    I'm just changing the test to use a known  printer type that works rather than trusting  the default."

28594	area-System.ComponentModel	Proposal: new System.ComponentModel.VersionConverter class	"## Rationale and Usage    Converting between `System.Version` and `string` is currently not supported using a `System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter`. Many system types are supported out of the box (System.DateTimeOffset, System.Guid, System.TimeSpan, System.Uri etc.) so I think System.Version would be a welcome addition.    I was expecting this to work, but converting from string actually throws `NotSupportedException`: TypeConverter cannot convert from System.String.    ```csharp  using System.ComponentModel;  using System.Diagnostics;  TypeConverter versionConverter = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(typeof(Version));  Version version = versionConverter.ConvertFromString(""1.2.3.4"") as Version;  Trace.Assert(version.Major == 1);  Trace.Assert(version.Minor == 2);  Trace.Assert(version.Build == 3);  Trace.Assert(version.Revision == 4);  ```    ## Proposed API    ```csharp  public partial class VersionConverter : System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter  {      public VersionConverter();      public override bool CanConvertFrom(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, System.Type sourceType);      public override bool CanConvertTo(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, System.Type destinationType);      public override object ConvertFrom(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture, object value);      public override object ConvertTo(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture, object value, System.Type destinationType);      public override bool IsValid(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, object value);  }  ```    ## Details    Converting between `string` and `System.Version` is very straightforward, implementation would be very similar to `GuidConverter` or `UriTypeConverter`.      ## Open Questions    * What exception should be thrown when the string to convert is not valid, for example `""1""`? Other converters just let the constructor of the type throw the exception.    ```csharp  var uriConverter = System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(typeof(Uri));  uriConverter.ConvertFromString(""mailto:User@""); // throws UriFormatException  ```    ```csharp  var guidConverter = System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(typeof(Guid));  guidConverter.ConvertFromString(""xxxx""); // throws FormatException  ```    For `System.Version`, that would mean throwing an `ArgumentException` which is less descriptive than a `FormatException`.    * Should the converter be registered with other `IntrinsicTypeConverters` (is System.Version an intrinsic type?) or should the converter be registered with the `TypeConverterAttribute` on the `System.Version` class?    ## Pull Request    A pull request with the proposed changes is available: #28516  "

28591	area-System.Runtime	DllImport and current directory	"We need to start several processes from a single application (all .NET Core 2.0 console app) using `Process.Start` and `ProcessStartInfo`. First, we found this  [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28590) about `ProcessStartInfo.WorkingDirectory` which seems to not work. Now that we use `Directory.SetCurrentDirectory` in the started application, .NET assemblies are well resolved/loaded but we have another error with a `DllImport` which cannot load the native dll:  `System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL '***' : The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)`    The dll is of course in the same directory as its executable. I have tried to add a `SetCurrentDirectory` + `SetDllDirectory` in the Main method w/o any effects. And also added the directory in the PATH.    Of course, everything ""works on my machine"" (windows 10, .NET Core SDK 2.1.103) and it only happens in the staging env (windows server 2016 .NET Core SDK 2.1.101).    So to summarize:    - If the app is started from the CLI using `dotnet ***.dll`, it _works from any directory_    - If the app is started the same way from another process using `Process.Start()`, it **fails**    - If the app is published as an executable, it _works using the CLI from its current directory_  But it **fails from the parent directory** and of course, also using `Process.Start()` (which is the excpected use case)    Last detail: the DllImport is done in the context of an `Activator.CreateInstance` (using Windsor)"

We do a `Directory.SetCurrentDirectory` in the started application as a workaround.    .NET Core 2.1.101
28588	area-System.Net	enable tcp keep-alive on curl handler	"fixes #28119     This is outcome of investigation not originally reported on github.  Patch was provided to customer and we verified that it fixes observed issue.     Observed delay is caused by retransmits and timeout in cases when upstream Azure firewall cuts connection without sending FIN or RST. curl on OSX is build agains ressl and in that case we create singleton under the cover. Because of that, normal tricks to dispose and recycle HttpHandler or HttpClinet don't work and curl was using  connections even after very long idle time.     When tested on Ubuntu, the keep-alive message were sent because of enabled by OS.   This change is currently not OSX specific - it would make all NIX system consistent - either with keep-alive enable by OS or by curl handler it self. All that is handled as OS level and it will not impact any of our I/O operations.  Also note that this will happen only on idle connection so that should not be really impact under ""normal"" use.

28573	area-Infrastructure	Prevent CMake 2.8 tests failing for unused variable (causing millisec to be dropped from stat calls)	"Fix https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27662 which only reproduced with bits built from official build machines.    The millisecond part of the stat structs can appear in several forms or possibly not be available so we probe for it with CMake's such:  ```c  check_struct_has_member(      ""struct stat""      st_atim      ""sys/types.h;sys/stat.h""      HAVE_STAT_TIM)  ```    This was failing on the official build machines even though st_atim is present in the struct. The cause can be found in `corefx/bin/obj/Linux.x64.Debug/native/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log`  ```  Building C object CMakeFiles/cmTryCompileExec161514853.dir/src.c.o  /usr/local/bin/clang-3.9   -std=gnu99 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DHAVE_STAT_TIM -Werror   -o CMakeFiles/cmTryCompileExec161514853.dir/src.c.o   -c /root/corefx/bin/obj/Linux.x64.Debug/native/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp/src.c  /root/corefx/bin/obj/Linux.x64.Debug/native/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp/src.c:8:9: error: expression result unused [-Werror,-Wunused-value]     tmp->st_atim;     ~~~  ^~~~~~~  1 error generated.  gmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/cmTryCompileExec161514853.dir/src.c.o] Error 1   ```    This is because the test code is like this:  ```c    #include <sys/types.h>  #include <sys/stat.h>    int main()  {     struct stat* tmp;     tmp->st_atim;    return 0;  }  ```    In later versions of CMake it looks like this which avoids the warning/error.  ```c  int main()  {     (void)sizeof(((struct stat *)0)->st_atim);     return 0;  }   ```    The fix is to specifically disable warning as error for this diagnostic. I verified this fixes it on the build machine:  ```  -- Performing Test HAVE_STAT_TIM  -- Performing Test HAVE_STAT_TIM - Success  ```    The main reason this took some time to root cause (other than it not reproing locally or in CI) was that I did not realize the official builds build in docker containers in order to achieve a portable build on Centos 7. So when I built on the official build boxes, I was picking up cmake version 3.5.1 rather than 2.8.12.2."

Two additional cases had to be moved to the SocketsHttpHandler only tests, since they fail on CurlHandler and do not have fixes yet.    The digest test cases have to use credentials without a domain when run against CurlHandler. This is because Curl does not allow us to set the realm parameter used to send the domain along with a digest authorization header. We could alternatively try to use the down level login name as the username, but it appears that there is a bug in the Curl escaping logic that causes backslashes in the username to be duplicated. I plan to open an issue in the Curl repo once things are a bit less busy.    All of the test cases that are SocketsHttpHandler only are now tracked by individual issues, so I think with this we can close #28065.

28553	area-System.Security	Crypo transforms should truncate long initialization vectors for compatibility	"TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider expects a 24 byte key and 8 byte initialization vector.     In .NET Framework, if an IV longer than the algorithm's block size (8 bytes) was used, [it would be truncated](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/security/cryptography/tripledescryptoserviceprovider.cs,101). In .NET Core, though, [an exception is thrown](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/1ce37dfb5a03e5decdb25ee67ef765f89424ceb1/src/System.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms/src/Internal/Cryptography/TripleDesImplementation.cs#L64).     This makes .NET Framework-targeted libraries that would otherwise be usable from .NET Core fail. It would be good to truncate the IV for compatibility's sake.    Repro  ------    Create a .NET Framework-targeted library using a too-long IV:    ```CSharp  public class CryptoHelper  {      public static string Encrypt(string input)      {          var key = new byte[24] { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0B,                                   0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19, 0x1A, 0x1B, };            // This should only be 8 bytes          var iv = new byte[24] { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0B,                                   0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19, 0x1A, 0x1B, };            var des = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider();          var encryptor = des.CreateEncryptor(key, iv);                    var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);          return Convert.ToBase64String(encryptor.TransformFinalBlock(data, 0 , data.Length));      }  }  ```    Use the library from a .NET Core application:  ```CSharp  Console.WriteLine(CryptoHelper.Encrypt(""Hello world!""));  ```    This results in the following exception:    ```  Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Specified initialization vector (IV) does not match the block size for this algorithm.

28551	area-Infrastructure	Packages which suppress NETStandard.Library reference cause downgrades when installed in `netcoreapp1.0`	"This is true for both the 2.1 packages we're building now as well as the 2.0 packages we shipped prior.    This manifests as `NU1605` errors.      As an example, install System.Buffers 4.4.0 in a `netcoreapp1.0` project.    For example:  ```  error NU1605: Detected package downgrade: System.IO.FileSystem.Primitives from 4.3.0 to 4.0.1. Reference the package directly from the project to select a different version.   error NU1605: project -> Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.5 -> NETStandard.Library 1.6.0 -> System.Console 4.0.0 -> runtime.unix.System.Console 4.3.0 -> System.IO.FileSystem.Primitives (>= 4.3.0)   error NU1605: project -> Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.5 -> NETStandard.Library 1.6.0 -> System.IO.FileSystem.Primitives (>= 4.0.1)  ```    The downgrade isn't caused by the common ancestor (`NETStandard.Library`) as the warning might lead you to believe.  Instead it's occurring because of the following dependency:    System.Buffers 4.4.0 -> System.Diagnostics.Debug 4.3.0 -> Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms 1.1.0 (runtime.json).    They are hitting this NuGet issue: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3541.    The set of packages impacted in the 2.1 release are the following:  - System.Buffers  - System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource  - System.Reflection.TypeExtensions  - System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe  - System.Security.Cryptography.Cng  - System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl  - System.Security.Principal.Windows  - System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions    They are only impacted on `.NETCoreApp1.0`.    If we wanted to fix this we could re-baseline to the 1.0 era packages: potentially breaking where folks counted on us bringing in the 1.1 version of packages in other TFMs.  Special case the dependencies only on NETCoreApp1.0 could limit this, but is still potentially breaking if folks even on NETCoreApp1.0 depended on a fix or API added in a 1.1 version of a package.    In the realm of workarounds, folks can suppress the warning on NETCoreApp1.0 with `<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);NU1605</NoWarn>`, however this can result in real downgrades sneaking through.  Alternatively you can lift up all of `NETStandard.Library` with `<PackageReference Include=""NETStandard.Library"" Version=""1.6.1"" />`, this bypasses the NuGet bug by lifting up every package to the 1.1 version which may be undesirable since you end up running on a mixed state.    /cc @joperezr @weshaggard "

28543	area-System.Net	Fix perf hit from WinHttpGetProxyForUrl 	The recent addition of calling WinHttpGetProxyForUrl by default for each SocketsHttpHandler request on Windows is adding non-trivial overhead, at least 5% to each request in a local measurement.  We should avoid that.  For example, by using WinHttpDetectAutoProxyConfigUrl to see if there's an autoproxy, and if there isn't, caching that knowledge and then skipping WinHttpGetProxyForUrl for all subsequent requests.  We may also need/want to query WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser in that case, again caching the results, similar to what's done on Unix.    cc: @karelz, @wfurt, @geoffkizer

28541	area-System.Net	Replace custom date parsing for HttpDateParse	"fixes #12513    Added exploratory tests, then modified those tests into what DateTime(Offset).Parse can handle.  Also fixes the following bugs in the original:   - considered ANSI dates to be local (to the _receiver_, no less), instead of UTC/GMT like the spec says.   - accepted offset values (ie, `+05:00`), but didn't actually use them.   - would throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if a string token didn't have enough distinguishing characters (ie, `'S'` throws, because it needs to check the next character for `'a'`/`'u'` for Saturday/Sunday)    Retains case insensitivity of the original.  Drops ability to use partially matching day-of-week/month strings (ie, the original parses `""Surprise""` as `""Sunday""`).  Drops ability to use non-matching date/day-of-week strings (ie `""Sat, 25 Mar 2018 16:33:01 GMT""` - the 25th was actually a Sunday)  Drops ability to use arbitrary characters as separators.  Now allows arbitrary amounts of whitespace between tokens.    Attempting to retain any of the previous compatibility changes would require changes to `DateTime.Parse`, which I am somewhat loathe to do.    I'm going to assume these changes represent a performance regression, given the previous implementation was highly optimized (if somewhat buggy).  Additionally, the way the previous code was written makes me think it was pulled from C/C++ somewhere - I don't know whether that should be looked into.  "

28538	area-Infrastructure	Mega-solution needed	As a newbie to this repo, I find it very difficult to figure out where anything is. And when I do finally find what I need, I then have to try finding out where the test classes are. I'm sure it makes sense once you get it, but I don't get it. Beyond just finding classes, I'd love to able to navigate from project to project using F12 and Shift-F12, to see where the member was defined or what other members access it.    I think a solution that contained all the projects and all the test projects would be immensely beneficial. I couldn't find an issue here on this topic, but I have seen other baffled developers on the forums.    Thoughts?

28523	area-System.Net	Digest parsing on SocketsHttpHandler is not as robust as on WinHttpHandler	In one of the `WWW-Authenticate` header test cases, unquoted digest parameters are successfully parsed by `WinHttpHandler`, but not by `SocketsHttpHandler`.  The test case was written to expect a `401` response, but failed on WinHttpHandler when the request successfully authenticated.    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/00547db7233076da50db7b4d6e1a8e7ff1710ed0/src/System.Net.Http/tests/FunctionalTests/SocketsHttpHandlerTest.cs#L571    The Wireshark traces below demonstrate the issue, with `SocketsHttpHandler` on the left and `WinHttpHandler` on the right.    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4656175/37993307-119053cc-31c3-11e8-930c-4a03d83f715e.png)    This case isn't technically legal as per the spec, since realm and nonce are required to be quoted. I think we should fix it eventually since it is a regression from WinHttpHandler, but I'm not sure how to prioritize it. @karelz do you have any thoughts?
28522	area-System.Net	Digest authentication resubmit differences between WinHttpHandler & SocketsHttpHandler	This behavior difference causes a hang in the HTTP authentication tests. I'll summarize the issue here, with my thoughts at the bottom. I've been wrong about this particular failure before, so I'll try to stick to just the facts :)    In two of the `WWW-Authenticate` header test cases, an invalid `Digest` scheme will cause `WinHttpHandler` to resubmit the original request. `SocketsHttpHandler` will instead close the connection and return the 401 response immediately. The Wireshark traces below demonstrate both cases, with `SocketsHttpHandler` on the left.    Digest with an unsupported algorithm:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4656175/37983480-7575dd50-31a8-11e8-9850-6a7ae55de978.png)  Digest with no realm or nonce:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4656175/37983564-a798ffce-31a8-11e8-971b-0df28f1a1baf.png)  The extra newline in the SocketsHttpHandler case is added by wireshark and is not a part of the actual message. Note that I modified the test slightly while getting these screenshots -- I stopped the loopback server from closing the connection immediately after the 401, which was causing a hang in `WinHttpHandler` when it sent the second get request and got no response. The test case is still the same for both handlers.    The re submission happening in WinHttpHandler is primarily caused by WinHttp. We make the following call to query supported auth schemes:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/b458c89b34ba2a84858312a487066bdc2ba350e3/src/System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler/src/System/Net/Http/WinHttpAuthHelper.cs#L90-L95  In both cases WinHttp returns the value `WINHTTP_AUTH_SCHEME_DIGEST`, indicating that digest authentication is the only supported scheme. We then set the credentials, but when the request is sent WinHttp has not included them.    **Opinions below:**  I think that the `SocketsHttpHandler` behavior is correct, and that the `WinHttpHandler` behavior should be considered a (minor) bug. Since we rely on WinHttp to determine what auth schemes are available, I would tentatively call this a WinHttp bug. For the time being, I'd like to modify the test to support both cases. I'd like to hear what others think though.
28521	area-System.Net	WinHttpHandler does not authenticate when unknown parameters are present with basic auth	"The [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617#section-2  ) for Basic authentication states that unknown parameters must be ignored:    >No other authentication parameters are defined -- unknown  parameters MUST be ignored by recipients, and new parameters can  only be defined by revising this specification.    There are two cases that test this which are failing on `WinHttpHandler`:  ```csharp  yield return new object[] { ""Basic realm=\""testrealm1\"" basic realm=\""testrealm1\"""", true };  yield return new object[] { ""Basic something digest something"", true };  ```  The above cases look like additional auth schemes, but since they are not comma separated, they are considered additional parameters. On `WinHttpHandler` these headers are rejected, when the extra parameters should really just be ignored.    `WinHttpHandler` is depending on WinHttp to parse the `WWW-Authenticate` header, so I see this as an issue we are unlikely to fix without customer reports. With that in mind I'm moving this to future."

Do differentiate error cases (in tests) and make other uses cases like TryParse or Validate possible we should refactor the current exception handling. I'm thinking about the following options:    a) Introduce a RegexParseException which inherits from ArgumentException to not break existing code that contains an enum status code that tells the parse error code. From this we can then build the existing error messages. This options doesn't support TryParse / Validate scenarios.  b) Return a RegexParseEnum that tells what went wrong. Ultimately this will be wrapped inside an ArgumentException to not break existing code. TryParse / Validate scenarios can either return this enum or return the error message from it.  c) Keep everything as it is and only tests if ArgumentExceptions are thrown during negative tests.    cc @stephentoub @danmosemsft @CyrusNajmabadi

28501	area-System.ComponentModel	EmailAddressAttribute behaves differently in .NET Core vs. NetFx	"It behaves differently for the following Unit Tests and I think both behaviours are not 100% correct:  Just for reference:  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.emailaddressattribute(v=vs.110).aspx    ```csharp  public class UnitTest1  {      private static EmailAddressAttribute AddressAttribute = new EmailAddressAttribute();        [Theory]      [InlineData(""test@test.com"", true)]      [InlineData(""test@test.co.uk"", true)]      [InlineData(""test+t@test.co.uk"", true)]      [InlineData(""test"", false)]      [InlineData(""test.com"", false)]      [InlineData(""test@test"", false)]      [InlineData(""test@test."", false)]      public void EmailValidity(string email, bool result)      {          Assert.Equal(result, AddressAttribute.IsValid(email));      }  }  ```  In NetFX 4.7 all tests succeed.  In NetCore 1.0/2.0 the tests for ""test@test"" and ""test@test."" fail.    In #25129 @PeterSmithRedmond said that atleast test@test is a valid email, but as far as i understand the spec test@test.  (notice the dot) is not, the domain part is called dot-atom in the spec https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.2.4 and has either no dot or dot and other valid symbols after the dot.    If I'm correct there are bugs in both implementations, in netfx the test for ""test@test"" should fail (because it's a valid address) and in net core the test for ""test@test."" should succeed, because it's not a valid address.

28466	area-System.IO	[Desktop] FileStream.ReadAsync() fails with System.IO.IOException: The media is write protected.	This occurs sporadically when copying files from an SD card whose write protect tab is not engaged. The FileStream is the only handle opened on the file and is created using        new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read, 1024 * 1024, FileOptions.Asynchronous | FileOptions.SequentialScan)    .NET 4.7.1, Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Lenovo T440s built in Realtek PCI-E SD card reader with driver version 10.0.10125.21277. Some investigation shows the SD card is mounted read only in these cases, which is not expected and may signal an issue in Realtek's driver, but this doesn't explain why operations on a read only handle are failing because write permission is unavailable. There is a second concurrent task writing the data read to another file on an SSD but, for both tasks, the FileStreams are local.        new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None, 1024 * 1024, FileOptions.Asynchronous | FileOptions.SequentialScan | FileOptions.WriteThrough);    The underlying native API is [SetFilePointerEx()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365542.aspx). Since the two handles in use are distinct and used single threaded I don't see any obvious races in code review.

28450	area-System.Collections	ConcurrentStack  PushRange idea	[ConcurrentStack](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Collections.Concurrent/src/System/Collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentStack.cs) has a `PushRange` method that takes in an array/set of items.  ```c#  public void PushRange(T[] items);  public void PushRange(T[] items, int startIndex, int count);  ```    `PushRange` has a very useful optimization in that it creates a pre-made linked list, then attaches the tale to the current head, which makes it very efficient at adding the entire set **with a single successful CAS**(compare and swap). I think limiting `PushRange` to only arrays may encourage bad usage or force the user to using arrays.    I was wondering about some other signatures that could help facilitate the bulk adding of items without having to work with arrays or calling 'ToArray' on your favorite set object.    ```c#  public void PushRange(T[] items);  public void PushRange(T[] items, int startIndex, int count);    public void PushRange(IList<T> items);  public void PushRange(IList<T> items, int startIndex, int count);    public void PushRange(IEnumerable<T> items);  ```    I get this feeling that people are just doing, because it's easy enough  ```c#  foreach(var i in items)   stack.Push(i);  ```  in lieu of a bulk push method for other set types. But this will result in many more CAS operations, increasing contention.    fyi, T[] implements IList<T>, so you could just redirect `PushRange(T[] items...)` to `PushRange(IList<T> items...)`

28447	area-System.Threading	Dequeue growth method optimizations	The [Grow()](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Threading.Channels/src/System/Collections/Generic/Dequeue.cs#L94) method some peculiarities that could potentially help with reading or optimizations.    First off `Debug.Assert(_size == _array.Length);` guarantees that these two values are synonymous. Instead of a mix and match of using `_array.Length` in some areas and `_size` in others, just use `_size`.    Another is this part  ```c#  const int MinimumGrow = 4;    int capacity = (int)(_array.Length * 2L);  if (capacity < _array.Length + MinimumGrow)  {   capacity = _array.Length + MinimumGrow;  }    T[] newArray = new T[capacity];  ```  `_array` starts off as an empty array `private T[] _array = Array.Empty<T>();`. This means it is a length of zero. The only time `if (capacity < _array.Length + MinimumGrow)` will ever be true is when the array is empty or 0. If I incorporate the first idea along with this one, it could be re-written as this:    ```c#  const int MinimumGrow = 4;    int capacity = _size == 0 ? MinimumGrow : _size * 2;    T[] newArray = new T[capacity];  ```  or if you want to assume the typical condition to be `true`  ```c#  const int MinimumGrow = 4;    int capacity = _size > 0 ? _size * 2: MinimumGrow ;    T[] newArray = new T[capacity];  ```
28445	area-System.Net	ManagedWebSocket implementation doesn't efficiently support reading when small buffer size used	The end to end scenario is to allocate as little memory as possible for idle websockets since it's possible to have more concurrent websockets if we don't burn memory if there's no data (http://goroutines.com/10m). Today, the websocket implementation has an internal buffer that can be controlled during creation of the websocket. This buffer can be 14 bytes minimally (size of the largest websocket header) so specifying a buffer of that size would be ideal.     The plan is to do it at both layers. Using libuv this is already the case and we're now trying to add it to the socket transport https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/pull/2393. SignalR also has to do it at the websocket layer https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/1603. The chain looks like this:    ```  WebSocket.ReceiveAsync(0)     HttpUpgradeStream.ReceiveAsync(14) // This is the internal buffer for the websocket header         RequestBodyPipeReader.ReadAsync()  // This is waiting on data to be written to the transport input            Transport.Input.ReadAsync()   // This is waiting on data to be read out of the socket.                socket.ReceiveAsync(0)  ```      Turns out there's an issue with the existing implementation where it tries to read up the internal buffer size per read size regardless of the buffer that was passed into ReceiveAsync:    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/23165cee77ae4dd7a7645b7927872948bb27a73e/src/Common/src/System/Net/WebSockets/ManagedWebSocket.cs#L696-L702    This means we'll get data in 14 byte chunks even if we pass a 4K buffer in to fill.    /cc @stephentoub @BrennanConroy

Also this freezes the implementation for netstandard2.0 for System.Buffers to not take a reference to System.Private.CoreLib in an OOB package.    Also I'm updating the compat pack publish script to be able to generate the netcoreapp2.1 ApiCatalog layout from the live everyday build.    cc: @ericstj @weshaggard @danmosemsft @joperezr @terrajobst 
28426	area-System.Drawing	TypeConverters for System.Drawing	"Closes #21129    Added converters `FontConverter`, `IconConverter`, `ImageConverter `and `ImageFormatConverter` and tests.    What I changed against original files from Mono:    - Changed variable and other names to suit coding style.  - Used resource for `(none)` string and throwing exception using base `GetConvertFromException()`.  - [ImageConverter](https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/System.Drawing/System.Drawing/ImageConverter.cs#L80) returned string `(none)` always, even if destination type was not string. Changed it only for string destination type.  - In [Icon](https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/System.Drawing/System.Drawing/IconConverter.cs#L83) and [Image](https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/System.Drawing/System.Drawing/ImageConverter.cs#L86) converter they called `CanConvertTo` with a comment that destination is a `byte[]`. I changed it to simple type check.  - Tests for exception with `try-catch` replaced with `Assert.Throws()`.  - Tests `Assert.True(!...)` replaced with `Assert.False(...)`.  - Cryptic messages (e.g. `""CCF#9""`) in assertions replaced with meaningful ones.  - In the tests, there are `Assert.Equal()` checks. In the original files in Mono they had message (`Assert.AreEqual()`), so specific assertion could be found when test fails. In XUnit, this assertion does not have a message."

28418	area-System.Net	Segmentation fault (core dumped) with microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime-stretch-arm32v7	"@Zuendelmeister commented on [Fri Mar 23 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/443)    ## Steps to reproduce the issue  1. Install docker ce on a raspberry pi 3   2. Start microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime-stretch-arm32v7 container with dotnet core code. Code uses http client that sends via post to a rest endpoint several times.  3. Code:  ```c#              var request = new HttpRequestMessage              {                  RequestUri = new Uri(_url),                  Method = HttpMethod.Post,                  Headers ={                      {HttpRequestHeader.Authorization.ToString(),_auth},                      {HttpRequestHeader.ContentType.ToString(),""application/json""}                  },                  Content = new StringContent(messageData)              };              using (var handler = new HttpClientHandler              {                  ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) => true,                  UseProxy = false              })              {                  using (var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler)                  {                      BaseAddress = new Uri(_url)                  })                  {                      Console.WriteLine(""start sending..."");                      var response =  await httpClient.SendAsync(request); //This is where the problem occurs!!!                      Console.WriteLine($""Sending done: StatusCode: {response?.StatusCode}"");                  }              }   ```    ## Expected behavior  The code should just send data to the rest endpoint.    ## Actual behavior  It sends messages for a while (like 100) to the endpoint and dies with the error Segmentation fault (core dumped). This cannot be catched.    ## Additional information (e.g. issue happens only occasionally)  On raspberry pi 3 with the docker base-image microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime-stretch-arm32v7.  I changed the baseimage and it works, so it's pretty save, that this issue is due to this one. Unfortunately I don't have any idea why.    ## Output of `docker version`  ```  Client:   Version:       18.03.0-ce   API version:   1.37   Go version:    go1.9.4   Git commit:    0520e24   Built: Wed Mar 21 23:18:23 2018   OS/Arch:       linux/arm   Experimental:  false   Orchestrator:  swarm    Server:   Engine:    Version:      18.03.0-ce    API version:  1.37 (minimum version 1.12)    Go version:   go1.9.4    Git commit:   0520e24    Built:        Wed Mar 21 23:14:29 2018    OS/Arch:      linux/arm    Experimental: false    ```    ## Output of `docker info`    ```  Containers: 2   Running: 0   Paused: 0   Stopped: 2  Images: 3  Server Version: 18.03.0-ce  Storage Driver: overlay2   Backing Filesystem: extfs   Supports d_type: true   Native Overlay Diff: false  Logging Driver: json-file  Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs  Plugins:   Volume: local   Network: bridge host macvlan null overlay   Log: awslogs fluentd gcplogs gelf journald json-file logentries splunk syslog  Swarm: inactive  Runtimes: runc  Default Runtime: runc  Init Binary: docker-init  containerd version: cfd04396dc68220d1cecbe686a6cc3aa5ce3667c  runc version: 4fc53a81fb7c994640722ac585fa9ca548971871  init version: 949e6fa  Security Options:   apparmor   seccomp    Profile: default  Kernel Version: 4.4.0-1009-raspi2  Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  OSType: linux  Architecture: armv7l  CPUs: 4  Total Memory: 920.1MiB  Name:   ID: UUUL:DQMQ:S7ES:WMO6:QEWB:E7UW:FQEO:QG3S:AZO7:NBK4:B2OT:D7SI  Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker  Debug Mode (client): false  Debug Mode (server): false  Registry: https://index.docker.io/v1/  Labels:  Experimental: false  Insecure Registries:      127.0.0.0/8  Live Restore Enabled: false    ```    [EDIT] Add C# syntax highlighting by @karelz"
28417	area-System.Net	Unify HTTP Authentication Tests	"Most of these were failing due to issues in the loopback authentication server that were fixed by @wfurt. I'll explain the other changes one by one below:    Original:  ```csharp  yield return new object[] { ""Basic realm=\""testrealm1\"" basic realm=\""testrealm1\"""", true };  ```  Updated:  ```csharp  yield return new object[] { ""Basic realm=\""testrealm1\"" basic realm=\""testrealm1\"""", true };  yield return new object[] { ""Basic realm=\""testrealm1\"", basic realm=\""testrealm1\"""", true };  ```    The first is an invalid case, but actually does work with WinHttpHandler. This test was failing just because of the loopback server. I added a valid version of this test, but left the original in to pin our current behavior.    Original (removed):  ```csharp  yield return new object[] { ""Basic something digest something"", true };  ```    The second change is to remove an invalid test case. This case highlights a minor behavior difference between WinHttpHandler and SocketsHttpHandler. Since there is no comma following the first scheme, all handlers will view this as a header requesting basic auth. The difference is that WinHttpHandler will refuse to authenticate when there are unknown tokens following the scheme. SocketsHttpHandler will just ignore the extra information. The correct behavior here isn't clear -- the only token allowed after basic auth is the realm, so either behavior sounds reasonable. I don't know if this is something we'd like to unify.

28410	area-System.Text	Regex Match, Split and Matches should support RegexOptions.AnyNewLine as (?=[\r\n]|\z)	From [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-options#Multiline):    > By default, $ matches only the end of the input string. If you specify the RegexOptions.Multiline option, it matches either the newline character (\n) or the end of the input string. It does not, however, match the carriage return/line feed character combination. To successfully match them, use the subexpression \r?$ instead of just $.    This is by far one of the biggest gotchas with using .NET Regex class.    I suggest adding a RegexOptions.AnyNewLine which treats $ as matching _both_ Windows' Environment.NewLine and UNIX' Environment.NewLine, regardless of the Environment running corefx.    *Portability concerns*  According to Wikipedia, there are a ton of different operating systems, all with different line ending settings. The current implementation hardcodes Unix line-ending style. RegexOptions.AnyNewLine, defined as (?=[\r\n]|\z), would add support for Windows line-ending style.    The advise written in the current docs is actually not portable on Unix, which is becoming a more popular option. As it is suggested, \r?$ will capture one or two lines on Unix, and one on Windows. If you try running Windows assemblies with this hack on Linux, you will change the semantics of programs.    *Backward compatibility concerns*  Fully backward compatible: This RegexOptions enum extension would not be a default, and so it would not break any clients with reasonably written code. The only existing code that might display different behavior would be reflection code that sets every option on RegexOptions enum variable. I really can't envision anyone doing this on purpose.    Here is Petr Onderka (@svick)'s summary:     OS | Line-ending style | Current | Environment.NewLine | AnyNewLine  -- | -- | -- | -- | --  Windows | Windows | ✗ | ✓ | ✓  Windows | Unix | ✓ | ✗ | ✓  Unix | Windows | ✗ | ✗ | ✓  Unix | Unix | ✓ | ✓ | ✓

28392	area-Meta	Inconsistent compile behavior for out parameters	@marce155 commented on [Thu Mar 22 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1373)  When declaring an out parameter on a method I’m used to having to assign the parameter a value before leaving the method:   ```  public bool TryGet(string foo, out TimeSpan bar){   bar = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);   return true;  }  ```    Today I encountered a behavior which was at least unexpected and feels inconsistent. When I’m targeting netcoreapp2.0 there are some cases where the program will compile and work even if the out parameter has not been assigned.    To be exact this is the case for TimeSpan or structs containing (only) a TimeSpan (that is as far as I tested). The same code will fail to compile for .NET 4.6.    ```  class Program      {          public static void Main()          {              TimeSpan timeSpan;              Foo foo;              Bar bar;              //Baz baz;                TryTimeSpan(out timeSpan);              TryFoo(out foo);              TryBar(out bar);              //TryBaz(out baz);                Console.WriteLine(timeSpan);              Console.WriteLine(foo);              Console.WriteLine(bar);          }          private static bool TryTimeSpan(out TimeSpan timeSpan)          {       // no compile error - unexpected              return false;          }          private static bool TryFoo(out Foo foo)          {       // empty struct works with target net461 as well              return false;          }          private static bool TryBar(out Bar bar)          {       // no compile error - unexpected              return false;          }          /*          private static bool TryBaz(out Baz baz)          {              // compile error, baz not assigned for all targets - expected              return false;          }          */      }      struct Foo { }      struct Bar      {          public TimeSpan TimeSpan { get; set; }      }      struct Baz      {          public int Int { get; set; }      }  ```  I assume that somehow proper defaults are assigned, yet it still feels a little strange. Could you please clarify if this is expected behavior and what causes it?    ---  @danstur commented on [Thu Mar 22 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1373#issuecomment-375337998)  This definitely seems to violate the [specification](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/classes.md#output-parameters):     > Every output parameter of a method must be definitely assigned before the method returns.

28379	area-Meta	API Proposal: Add a ValueStringBuilder	"We should consider making a value based StringBuilder to allow low allocation building of strings.  While Span allows you to provide a writable buffer, in many scenarios we have a need to get or build strings and we don't know precisely how much space will be needed ahead of time. Having an abstraction that can grow beyond a given initial buffer is particularly useful as it doesn't require looping with `Try*` APIs- which can be both complicated and have negative performance implications.    We currently use `ValueStringBuilder` for this purpose internally. It starts with an optional initial buffer (which we often stackalloc) and will grow using ArrayPool<char> if needed.    ## Design Goals    1. Allow safe usage of stack memory  2. Use pooled memory when needed to reduce GC pressure  3. Allow dynamic and explicit capacity growth  4. Facilitate interop scenarios (i.e. passing as `char* szValue`)  5. Follow API semantics of StringBuilder & string where possible  6. Be stack allocated    ## API    Here is the proposed API:    ``` C#  namespace System.Text  {      public ref struct ValueStringBuilder      {          public ValueStringBuilder(Span<char> initialBuffer);            // The logical length of the builder (end of the ""string"")          public int Length { get; set; }            // Available space in chars          public int Capacity { get; }            // Ensure there is at least this amount of space          public void EnsureCapacity(int capacity);            // Get a pinnable reference to the builder. ""terminate"" ensures the builder has a null char after Length in the buffer.          public ref char GetPinnableReference(bool terminate = false);            // Indexer, allows setting/getting individual chars          public ref char this[int index] { get; }            // Returns a string based off of the current position          public override string ToString();            // Returns a span around the contents of the builder. ""terminate"" ensures the builder has a null char after Length in the buffer.          public ReadOnlySpan<char> AsSpan(bool terminate);            // To ensure inlining perf, we have a separate overload for terminate          public ReadOnlySpan<char> AsSpan();            public bool TryCopyTo(Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);            public void Insert(int index, char value, int count = 1);          public void Insert(int index, ReadOnlySpan<char> value, int count = 1);            public void Append(char c, int count = 1);          public void Append(ReadOnlySpan<char> value);            // This gives you an appended span that you can write to          public Span<char> AppendSpan(int length);            // Returns any ArrayPool buffer that may have been rented          public void Dispose()      }  }  ```    This is the current shape of our internal [`ValueStringBuilder`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/bb0e771d2d08fedce8fc598e620c5d66b361e9e7/src/mscorlib/shared/System/Text/ValueStringBuilder.cs):    ``` C#  namespace System.Text  {      internal ref struct ValueStringBuilder      {          public ValueStringBuilder(Span<char> initialBuffer);          public int Length { get; set; }          public int Capacity { get; }          public void EnsureCapacity(int capacity);            /// <summary>          /// Get a pinnable reference to the builder.          /// </summary>          /// <param name=""terminate"">Ensures that the builder has a null char after <see cref=""Length""/></param>          public ref char GetPinnableReference(bool terminate = false);          public ref char this[int index] { get; }            // Returns a string based off of the current position          public override string ToString();            /// <summary>          /// Returns a span around the contents of the builder.          /// </summary>          /// <param name=""terminate"">Ensures that the builder has a null char after <see cref=""Length""/></param>          public ReadOnlySpan<char> AsSpan(bool terminate);            // To ensure inlining perf, we have a separate overload for terminate          public ReadOnlySpan<char> AsSpan();            public bool TryCopyTo(Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);          public void Insert(int index, char value, int count);          public void Append(char c);          public void Append(string s);          public void Append(char c, int count);          public unsafe void Append(char* value, int length);          public void Append(ReadOnlySpan<char> value);            // This gives you an appended span that you can write to          public Span<char> AppendSpan(int length);            // Returns any ArrayPool buffer that may have been rented          public void Dispose()      }  }  ```    ## Sample Code    Here is a common pattern on an API that could theoretically be made public if ValueStringBuilder was public:  (Although we would call this one GetFullUserName or something like that.)    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/050bc33738887d9d8fcc9bc5965b7d9ca65bc7f4/src/System.Runtime.Extensions/src/System/Environment.Win32.cs#L40-L56    The caller is above this method:    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/050bc33738887d9d8fcc9bc5965b7d9ca65bc7f4/src/System.Runtime.Extensions/src/System/Environment.Win32.cs#L13-L38    Usage of AppendSpan:    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/3538128fa1fb2b77a81026934d61cd370a0fd7f5/src/System.Runtime.Numerics/src/System/Numerics/BigNumber.cs#L550-L560    I'll add more usage details and possible API surface area.    ## Notes    - Does using this remove the need for having a `bool TryGet*(Span)` overload? (see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/17097/files#r176560435)  - Should we allow you to make it non-growable? (So we can avoid TryGet above?)  - Can we get C# to allow using ref structs that have a `Dispose()` in a `using` statement? (https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/93)  - Do we care about `AppendFormat` overloads?  - `AppendSpan()` is a little tricky to grok- is there a better term/pattern?"
28378	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler will attempt digest authentication with an empty nonce	The nonce is an important part of the digest authentication protocol, and we should not attempt to authenticate without one. We currently have some incorrect test cases demonstrating this issue that pass only on SocketsHttpHandler:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/ce4ebdfbf2080a38855ab8df5c9bb553db8724af/src/System.Net.Http/tests/FunctionalTests/SocketsHttpHandlerTest.cs#L561-L565    Without a nonce digest authentication is vulnerable to [replay attacks](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3001/what-is-the-use-of-a-client-nonce/3024#3024). For this to actually occur the server requesting authentication would have to fail to send the nonce in the first place, but this is still an insecure scenario that we should not support.    Since it also requires insecure behavior from the server requesting authentication I think we can probably put this issue off until after 2.1, but I'd like to hear what others think first.

28370	area-System.Runtime	StringComparers should return 0 rather than throwing for GetHashCode(null)	`EqualityComparer<string>.Default.GetHashCode` returns `0` when provided with null.    The various `StringComparer`s, however, throw `ArgumentNullException`. This is frustrating because it means you can't always swap in something like `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase` for the default comparer.    Additionally, it feels inconsistent for `StringComparer`s to throw on null for `GetHashCode` because all other methods are null-safe:  ```  StringComparer.Ordinal.Equals(default(string), default(string)) => true  StringComparer.Ordinal.Compare(default(string), default(string)) => 0  ```    Therefore, I think we should consider changing the behavior of `GetHashCode` to be consistent with everything else.

28367	area-System.Net	Fix WinHttpHandler error handling	"This PR addresses some error handling problems in WinHttpHandler as well as  improves the error messages generated for WinHttpException.    This was root caused to a bug in WinHttp where it can't do a GET request with a  request body using chunked encoding. However, this exception was masked due to  an error handling bug caused by an inconsistency in how WinHttp associates  context values for callbacks during the WinHttpSendRequest API call. This PR now  fixes the error handling around synchronous errors being returned from  WinHttpSendRequest. The root WinHttp bug itself can't be fixed. So, doing a GET request  will still throw an exception, but it will be a catchable HttpRequestException.    Another bug was discovered while investigating #26278. WinHttpCloseHandle should only be  called once and should never race between threads. This is normally protected when  the request handle is closed via SafeHandle Dispose(). But there was a place in the  callback method where we called WinHttpCloseHandle directly against the raw handle.    Finally, the error messages for WinHttpExceptions have been improved to show the  error number and the probable WinHttp API call that generated the error. This will  save diagnostic time.    Example:    Original WinHttpException message: ""The parameter is incorrect""  New WinHttpException message: ""Error 87 calling WinHttpSendRequest, 'The parameter is incorrect'.""    I also moved the WinHttpException source code back from Common. It was originally shared between WinHttpHandler and ClientWebSocket. But then ClientWebSocket moved away from WinHttp implementation. So, it makes more sense for this class to be under WinHttpHandler.    Closes #28156  Contributes to #26278"

28365	area-System.Net	SSL TLS protocol mis-match not handled cleanly on Linux	"Hello,    I had a situation where I specified `SslProtocls.Tls` and tried to talk to a server with `Tls` (aka `Tlsv1`) but the server was configured to not speak that protocol.    Understandably, the handshake failed, but the exception stack trace I got was pretty opaque and it took me a while to debug.  This is on Linux. Not sure if there is more information that we can use to improve the error message, but regardless, filing an issue at least so that if someone else hits the same thing they know that it is an error in protocol negotiation. Setting `SslProtocols` to `SslProtocols.None` (aka ""use system defaults"") fixed it for me.    Detailed trace:  ```  Unhandled Exception: System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred.

28363	area-System.Runtime	Enable AVX2, SSE42 HW intrinsics: remove unimplemented API surface and mark ISAs as fully implemented	Decision to disable not fully implemented Intel HW intrinsics was made due to the fact that corefx already exposed full ISA API while RyuJIT only partially supported them what would interfere with proper use of `ISA.IsSupported` check see issue:  https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/14930 and PR resolving it  https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15514.    AVX2 and SSE42 intrinsics are partially implemented with many useful instructions already exposed. IMO it would be very helpful if we would expose in `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental` assembly all already supported intrinsics including partially implemented ISAs. To avoid false negative reporting by `ISA.IsSupported` check we should remove all unimplemented APIs and mark AVX2 and SSE42 ISAs as fully implemented.    In future APIs could be expanded  as new functionality is added to RyuJIT.    @CarolEidt @eerhardt @fiigii @jkotas @tannergooding

This seems to create confusion and misguided attempts [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10667012/getting-downloads-folder-in-c) [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3795023/how-to-programmatically-derive-windows-downloads-folder-userprofile-downloads) [3](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/b344b1dd-d751-4e0e-9025-a391edd1949a/how-do-i-determine-the-windows-download-folder-path-using-the-knownfolders-class?forum=vbgeneral) to compute the paths to these folders by taking an existing value from `Environment.SpecialFolder`, dropping its last directory and appending ""Downloads"" to it. This is very error-prone, as the folder has not only different names based on the user locale, but also can be manually changed by users.    ## Changes    Two values are added to the `SpecialFolder` enum:    ```diff            MyComputer = SpecialFolderValues.CSIDL_DRIVES,  +         Downloads = SpecialFolderValues.CSIDL_DOWNLOADS,            MyMusic = SpecialFolderValues.CSIDL_MYMUSIC,            MyPictures = SpecialFolderValues.CSIDL_MYPICTURES,            MyVideos = SpecialFolderValues.CSIDL_MYVIDEO,  +         Public = SpecialFolderValues.CSIDL_PUBLIC,            Recent = SpecialFolderValues.CSIDL_RECENT,  ```    If this is desired, I'm happy to provide a pull request."

I was able to successfully set the `SocketOption` `KeepAlive` to Use Keep-Alives via `SetSocketOption` method  `_socket.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.Socket, SocketOptionName.KeepAlive, true);`  However I am having trouble setting `keepalivetime` and `keepaliveinterval` values.    It is my understanding that using `Socket.IOControl` method with `IOControlCode.KeepAliveValues` would be the correct method to set the above mentioned values. However, the comment in the IOControl method below seems the suggest that IOControl is used for Windows-specific IOCTL operations.  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/Socket.cs#L1763    If that is indeed the case then:  - Is it possible to set `keepalivetime` and `keepaliveinterval` values on Linux  - If yes, then what would the correct format of struct to use on Linux    Regards,  Keerat

When a double or single property or field is attributed to say the default value is NaN, the IL and reflection based serializers still serialize the NaN value. It is expected that when a field or property has the same value as the attributed default value, that the value is not serialized.     This issue is caused by the fact that the expression `double.NaN != double.NaN` will return true. These serializers need to be modified to use the `Equals` method on double/single as that accounts for the NaN value.

28314	area-System.Collections	Allow custom equality comparer on ConcurrentDictionary TryUpdate	The method `TryUpdate` from `ConcurrentDictionary` should allow to set a custom equality comparer for the value.    ## Rationale and Usage    A custom equality comparer for `TryUpdate` can target three problems.    ### Ahead Of Time    On some platforms is demanded static compilation ahead of time. On those platforms code generation is not allowed.  When the method `TryUpdate` use `EqualityComparer<T>.Default` for value type comparison, it attempts to use Reflection to instantiate a new type which implements the `IEqualityComparer<T>` interface. That operation is not allowed on AOT compiled code.    ### Performance    Currently the method `TryUpdate` uses the equality comparer instance from `EqualityComparer<T>.Default` which not be the most optimized comparison for the case.    ### Custom comparison    For external types not controlled by the user that does not implement the intended comparison it is needed to create a wrapper to overcome the lack of a proper comparison.  The same is true if a qualified comparison is needed for specific `TryUpdate` call.    ### Usage    Given those types:    ```csharp  readonly struct Person : IEquatable<Person>  {      public long Id { get; }      public string Name { get; }      public string Email { get; }      public int Version { get; }        public Person(int version)      {          Id = default;          Name = default;          Email = default;          Version = version;      }        public bool Equals(Person other) => Id == other.Id && Name == other.Name && Email == other.Email && Version == other.Version;      public override bool Equals(object obj) => obj is Person other && Equals(other);      public override int GetHashCode() => Id.GetHashCode();  }    sealed class VersioningComparer : IEqualityComparer<Person>  {      public bool Equals(Person first, Person second) => first.Version == second.Version;      public int GetHashCode(Person obj) => obj.Version;  }  ```    Can be used as:    ```csharp  private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<long, Person> personDictionary;  private readonly VersioningComparer versionComparer;  // ...  public bool UpdatePerson(Person value)  {      Person previousVersion = new Person(value.Version - 1);      return personDictionary.TryUpdate(value.Id, value, previousVersion, versionComparer);  }  ```    ## Proposed API    ```csharp  public class ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>  {  // ...      public bool TryUpdate(TKey key, TValue newValue, TValue comparisonValue);      public bool TryUpdate(TKey key, TValue newValue, TValue comparisonValue, System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<TValue> comparer);  // ...  }  ```    ## Pull Request    A PR with the proposed changes is available: #28142

28303	area-System.Security	Support exporting cryptographic keys to PEM format.	It would be very helpful to add the functionality to most of the asymmetric cryptographic algorithm implementations to add an explicit method to both import and export the cryptographic keys to the PEM file format.    We already have ```ToXmlString``` and ```FromXmlString``` on the [AsymmetricAlgorithm](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Security.Cryptography.Primitives/src/System/Security/Cryptography/AsymmetricAlgorithm.cs) base class  so adding a ```ToPemString``` and ```FromPemString``` would make sense to me at least.    I realize PEM is not exactly a standard format but it is being used extensively as format for encryption/signature keys in many utilities (like openssl) so supporting it for at least most common algorithms (RSA, ECDsa, X509, DSA, PKCS7, PKCS8) seems like a logical thing to do with .NET now being cross-platform.    The current format is mostly dictated by [RFC 7468](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468) as well as [OpenSSL's PEM handling](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/include/openssl/pem.h).
28301	area-System.Diagnostics	Question - What is the Difference between Debug Type Full & Pdb	"Hi,  I have a question regarding the build output when setting the Debug Type Full or Pdb-Only in project properties on .NET Core. As far as I could see the assemblies produced are the same? I also don't see any difference in the pdb files which are produced... but maybe am missing something.    In full framework there is definitely a difference and it could have perf impact on resulting code, should we have the same concerns on .NET Core? or is it a non-issue.    _""One difference between -debug:pdbonly and -debug:full is that with -debug:full the compiler emits a DebuggableAttribute, which is used to tell the JIT compiler that debug information is available. Therefore, you will get an error if your code contains the DebuggableAttribute set to false if you use -debug:full.

Borrows the tests from https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/28261 by @benaadams and builds on top of it.    - Ignore the formatting/clean up changes.  - The most important change is to the Seek and SeekMultiSegment methods. With this simplification, the fix in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/28261 is no longer necessary, since this PR supersedes it.     - This change greatly simplifies the implementation (and the disassembly shrinks, i.e. this will almost certainly help performance).

28289	area-Infrastructure	[Arm64/Ubuntu] Rework official build flow to support bootstrapping	@mmitche @weshaggard @janvorli @stephentoub PTAL    I was concerned the `buildpipeline/DotNet-CoreFx-Trusted-Linux-Crossbuild.json` wouldn't work for arm64.  I took a detailed look and I think I understood it enough to be certain it wouldn't work for arm64.      I manually built arm64 corefx packages.  Using this process so it should be close.    The primary impact of this patch is that   ```  ./build.sh              $(PB_BuildArguments)  ```  becomes  ```  ./build-native.sh       $(PB_BuildNativeArguments)  ./build-managed.sh      $(PB_BuildManagedArguments)  ./build-packages.sh     $(PB_BuildPackagesArguments)  ```  This allows cross bootstrapped builds by allowing the managed build to be built against x64.    The original draft of the patch added a new file   `DotNet-CoreFx-Trusted-Linux-Crossbuild-Bootstrap.json`, but this shared approach seemed better.    I will also update #28280 to use a similar flow and build all the way to packages.
28285	area-Meta	Some enhancements for  existing classes	Since there is many enhancements in the framework these days, I suggest to review all existing classes and update them to benefit from new features, such as:  - methods that receive objects and/or return objects can use generics.  - methods that have out parameters can have overloads that return ValueTuples  - All properties and parameters that only deal with positive numbers like Lengths, widths, heights, can be modified to use uint instead of int (same for other signed types). This will eliminate the need checks for raising exceptions for negative values, because the compiler can discover this in design time, or the cast will raise an exception in runtime. Also, Unsigned types have a double range than signed types.  - Add some Deconstructors to classes.  - The Math.Min and Math.Max can have a param array to allow compare three or more elements. Perhaps you can add some more math functions like factorial, sum, avg..... etc.  - and so on….  and so on.  I think most of these changes will not break any code. But I don't see any problem in breaking changes as long as they are for the best. Besides, one can always choose to run old projects on old frameworks version.

Since we don't want to duplicate all of these objects (as the lists can be quite large and memory consumption is a concern) we've created a type that acts similarly to the unsafe constructor on Span to access the items without duplicating them and handle type safety. There are some other lists we create on the C# side, and so to make consumption of our API simpler we just expose everything as an IReadOnlyList (since users shouldn't be modifying what we expose). **I'd love to be able to replace our type with Span for simplicity and for ""official"" support.**  "

28270	area-System.Data	System.Data.SqlClient.TdsParser  performance  improvement	I've done a little research and it looks like we do a lot of unnecessary allocations in the 'TryReadSqlDateTime' method.    For each call of the method we allocate the array of bytes (`` byte[] datetimeBuffer = new byte[length];``)  instead of allocating it once and then reuse existing array.    Let's imagine that we read 1 million DateTime values from database. Using existing implementation of TdsParser we will have 1 million allocations of byte[] what causes unnecessary memory traffic and isn't so good for GC.    So, if nobody minds, I'd make the described changes and then estimate benefits.

28251	area-System.IO	ReadOnlySequence's Enumerator returns different results for same struct.	Repro:  I am using Pipelines to obtain a ReadOnlySequence from a PipeReader. I am then iterating over the number of chunks in the buffer to count the buffer size, and then iterating again to add them into an array. Something like:    ```C#  var pipe = new Pipe(new SlabMemoryPool());    ...  var readResult = pipe.Reader.ReadAsync();  var readOnlySequence = readResult.Buffer;  var nChunks = 0;    for (var memory in readOnlySequence)  {      nChunks++;  }    var handles = new MemoryHandle[nChunks];  var currentChunk = 0;    for (var memory in readOnlySequence)  {      handles[currentChunk] = new MemoryHandle();      currentChunk++;  }  ```    The writer to the pipe is writing and flushing memory in a loop:  ```c#  pipe.Writer.Write(buffer);  pipe.Writer.FlushAsync();  ```    My hypothesis is that the enumerator is skipping empty segments somehow.  cc/ @pakrym  @davidfowl

Need a way to distinguish user intent.  * The spec allows for unencrypted and encrypted CertBags.  So we need a way to distinguish user intent.  * Technically speaking, all other bags have this same conundrum.  Only private keys are tri-state, though.    Algorithms:  * Windows 7 only supports the legacy PBES1 options.  * We definitely need to allow user expression of algorithm.  Should we require it?  Or have a default of ""What Windows 7 does""?    Design:  * Maybe ""build"" and ""read"" don't need to be the same class?    * If builder is separate, does it need ""append""?  * For a separate builder, it might be easiest to require the passwords/keys at construction time, and then have an API which is AddEncryptedContents(SafeBag) and AddUnencryptedContents(SafeBag).      * Or maybe SafeBags should have a property of whether they are (reader) or should-be (builder) encrypted."

We already have a SequenceEqual method (which only takes a single argument), which means, we would end up with a non-generic overload, specific to `ReadOnlySpan<char>`.    ```C#  public static bool SequenceEqual<T>(this ReadOnlySpan<T> span, ReadOnlySpan<T> other) where T : System.IEquatable<T> {}  public static bool SequenceEqual<T>(this Span<T> span, ReadOnlySpan<T> other) where T : System.IEquatable<T> {}  // ADD:  public static bool SequenceEqual(this ReadOnlySpan<char> span, ReadOnlySpan<char> other, StringComparison comparisonType) {}  ```    The alternative of adding an Equals overload that takes `string` as the argument will not work in resolving the overload matching issue.

"@bobuva commented on [Mon Mar 19 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1361)  I've updated to the .NET Core 2.1 preview in order to make an SSL connection. Our server requires an ALPN negotiation to occur. As I understand it, the preview is the first version of .NET Core to support ALPN.    Here is essentially what I'm doing:    ```   TcpClient tcpClient = new TcpClient();  tcpClient.Connect(ProxyClient.TestUbuntuHost, ProxyClient.TestUbuntuPort);  var stream = tcpClient.GetStream();  SslStream sslStream = new SslStream(stream, false, new RemoteCertificateValidationCallback(ValidateServerCertificate));    X509Certificate2 certificate = new X509Certificate2(@""<a filename provided>);  X509Certificate2Collection certColl = new X509Certificate2Collection(certificate);  sslStream.AuthenticateAsClient(                  ProxyClient.TestUbuntuHost,                  certColl,                  SslProtocols.Tls11 | SslProtocols.Tls12, false);  ```  The `ValidateServerCertificate` looks like this:  ```  public static bool ValidateServerCertificate(                object sender,                X509Certificate certificate,                X509Chain chain,                SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)  {              if (sslPolicyErrors == SslPolicyErrors.None)                  return true;                Console.WriteLine(""Certificate error: {0}"", sslPolicyErrors);                // Do not allow this client to communicate with unauthenticated servers.              return false;  }  ```  I get this error: ` System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.` whether or not I pass that 3rd param to the `SslStream` constructor.     Can you shed some light on whether I need to do something else to enforce the ALPN negotiation?    Thanks,   Bob  "

28208	area-System.Net	HttpContent.ReadAsStreamAsync is over-allocating memory	In order to reduce memory overhead, we make webrequests return when the headers have been read using:      `HttpClient.GetAsync(uri, HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead);`    The idea is that afterwards you'll be reading the bytes from the returned stream as they trickle in from the network. Or at least that's what I had hoped. But looking at the implementation, the moment you try and get the stream from the HttpContent, the entire stream is loaded into memory:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/HttpContent.cs#L253    If these responses are very large, it could exhaust the application for memory.  Instead the ReadAsStreamAsync should return a buffer immediately and have it get filled as the bytes gets downloaded.  The HttpCompletionOption doesn't really make much sense without doing this (apart from rejecting the response all-together based on the headers).

This is due XmlWriter.Create(...) creating a new Encoding instance (with a FallbackEncoder) from the one supplied in XmlWriterSettings. However, it only uses the CodePage to create the new Encoding instance which initializes with the defaults. The default for ByteOrderMark in the UTF32Encoding class is true.    This fixes it by grabbing the BOM before creating a the new Encoding instance.    cc: @krwq @pjanotti     Resolves #26544

28188	area-System.Collections	ConcurrentDictionary<,>.IsEmpty is barely faster than checking Count	I would assume that a specialist method named `IsEmpty` is significantly faster than simply obtaining the `Count` of a `ConcurrentDictionary<,>`, yet it appears to be just a touch slower.    x-ref https://github.com/WiseTechGlobal/WTG.Analyzers/pull/23#issuecomment-374116037    Similar to the benchmark in the linked above, here's a benchmark comparing an empty dictionary to one containing 1,200 items.    I would expect `Empty_IsEmpty` to take roughly the same amount of time as `Contents_IsEmpty`, but it appears to scale up similarly to testing against `Count`.    ```  // * Summary *    BenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.13, OS=Windows 10 Redstone 3 [1709, Fall Creators Update] (10.0.16299.309)  Intel Core i5-7600K CPU 3.80GHz (Kaby Lake), 1 CPU, 4 logical cores and 4 physical cores  Frequency=3703123 Hz, Resolution=270.0423 ns, Timer=TSC  .NET Core SDK=2.1.100-preview-007326    [Host]     : .NET Core 2.0.5 (CoreCLR 4.6.26020.03, CoreFX 4.6.26018.01), 64bit RyuJIT    DefaultJob : .NET Core 2.0.5 (CoreCLR 4.6.26020.03, CoreFX 4.6.26018.01), 64bit RyuJIT                 Method |        Mean |     Error |    StdDev |  Gen 0 | Allocated |  ----------------- |------------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|----------:|      Empty_IsEmpty |    67.29 ns | 0.0808 ns | 0.0716 ns |      - |       0 B |        Empty_Count |    67.49 ns | 0.0255 ns | 0.0199 ns |      - |       0 B |      Empty_LinqAny |   180.82 ns | 0.1109 ns | 0.0926 ns | 0.0203 |      64 B |   Contents_IsEmpty | 3,907.88 ns | 1.8701 ns | 1.7493 ns |      - |       0 B |     Contents_Count | 4,129.74 ns | 1.5337 ns | 1.3596 ns |      - |       0 B |   Contents_LinqAny |    42.68 ns | 0.0471 ns | 0.0417 ns | 0.0203 |      64 B |    ```    Is `IsEmpty` actually doing anything special or could the implementation just about be replaced with:    ```csharp  public bool IsEmpty => Count == 0;  ```    ?    I don't actually see a huge difference in the two implementations.

28180	area-System.Memory	SequenceEqual is very slow on .NET Framework x86	Performance regression introduced by change #28080.    A single call to SequenceEqual expands into 400 bytes of very inefficient code. .NET Framework x86 JIT is not able to optimize out the complex generic code.    If there is no way to make the type-specific optimizations work well, we should ifdef them out from the netstandard implementation. The portable System.Memory implementation will be slower, but it has to be fast enough to be usable on .NET Framework x86 because of it is likely going to be the most popular target for it.    ```

28179	area-System.Memory	Fix major System.Memory performance regression on .NET Framework x86	JIT on .NET Framework x86 can do only a limited amount of inlining of NUint operations per method. This caused a major performance regression in `Span.SequenceEqual<byte>` on .NET Framework x86.    This change is switching the implementation of `SequenceEqual<byte>` to use pointer-based arithmetic to fix this performance regression. Also included are related performance tweaks like using Unsafe.AddByteOffset instead of Unsafe.Add where possible.
28177	area-System.Collections	Improve inling in ImmutableArray<T>.Builder	The issue https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28064 is about a benchmark whose performance is so bad that a new dangerous method was considered to improve that situation. But almost the same effect can be achieved just by ensuring that the `Add()` method and the indexer setter on `ImmutableArray<T>.Builder` can be inlined (see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28064#issuecomment-373950250 for more details). This PR does that.    I have only verified that extracting the `throw` is useful for the indexer setter. But the indexer getter and `ItemRef` are very similar, so I assumed it makes sense for them too.

System.Data.Odbc.OdbcMetaData.xml was added to System.Data.Odbc  2. Refactored the files in System.Data.Odbc and System.Data.SqlClient and moved them to Common/src/System/Data/ProviderBase  2.a Only moved the files needed to make OdbcConnection.GetSchema() work.   2.b Added partial qualifier on some of the classes which had diverged because SqlClient supports TransactionScope.

The compiler should test the foo<T> for all these types, i.e. foo< int >, foo< float > , foo< byte >.  if the code of the foo class is ok in all these cases, then it should compile correctly (i.e doesn't complain about the x + y operation) .    # Benefit:  This will solve some problems when there is no common interface to use as a constraint. for more details: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27167    # Note: I asked also for C# syntax to define the list to avoid the long attribute syntax (https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1388). This would be:  ```  class foo<T>  where T: {int, float, byte}  {          void DoSomething(T x, T y)           {                   T z = x + y;            }   }    ```

28139	area-Infrastructure	System.Data.SqlClient cannot be found	Hi    In a specific scenario, I cannot load `System.Data.SqlClient` using the 2.0.6 runtime. The 2.0.5 runtime works.    A small repro : https://github.com/johnkors/sqlclient.runtime.test    A build of both runtimes:  https://travis-ci.org/johnkors/sqlclient.runtime.test/builds/354338277    In 2.0.5, I can use System.Data.SqlClient (ok, it fails to connect to a unknown db here - but using the dll works).  In 2.0.6, I get the FileNotFoundException.    >Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SqlClient, Version=4.2.0.2, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The system cannot find the file specified.    (bumping the the dependency on `System.Data.SqlClient` to 4.4.3 makes it work with both runtimes.)
28138	area-System.Net	WebSocketProtocol.CreateFromStream should allow specifying a receive buffer and a send buffer	Currently you can specify a receive buffer to the WebSocketProtocol.CreateFromStream API but you cannot control the send buffer. Currently the managed websocket implementation always allocates a pooled array for sends which may not be optimal if the underlying stream is already buffered (it introduces an extra layer of unnecessary buffering).    I'd like to propose we change this method to the following:    ```C#  using System.IO;    namespace System.Net.WebSockets  {      public static class WebSocketProtocol      {          public static WebSocket CreateFromStream(Stream stream, bool isServer, string subProtocol, TimeSpan keepAliveInterval, int? receiveBufferSize = null, int? sendBufferSize = null) { throw null; }          // Existing API:          public static WebSocket CreateFromStream(Stream stream, bool isServer, string subProtocol, TimeSpan keepAliveInterval, Memory<byte> buffer = default) { throw null; }      }  }  ```    I'd also like to get this in for 2.1 if possible 😄     A few questions:  - Today we allow passing a single buffer to the websocket API for receives but if you use a pooled buffer, you can only return it when the websocket is disposed. That would be the same deal for the sendBuffer.  - The existing WebSocket.CreateClient API just lets you specify the size of the internal buffer instead of taking a buffer directly. While this is less flexible, I'm not sure how useful it is to allow passing in the buffer itself to the WebSocket constructor. I might be missing something here.    Note: Existing API:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/cc590fd30b7000458d055164c641461d616ed33c/src/System.Net.WebSockets.WebSocketProtocol/ref/System.Net.WebSockets.WebSocketProtocol.cs#L14    /cc @stephentoub @karelz

28135	area-System.Net	Why does HttpClient in Core allow GET requests with bodies, while Framework version does not?	"_Opened on behalf of @IanKemp from https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1333_    -------  _@IanKemp writes -_   As per the title, the `HttpClient` implementation between Core and Framework differs in this regard. Consider the following example:    ```csharp  using (var client = new HttpClient())  {      var request = new HttpRequestMessage      {          RequestUri = new Uri(""some url""),          Method = HttpMethod.Get,      };        request.Content = new ByteArrayContent(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""some json""));        request.Content.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue(""application/json"");        var result = client.SendAsync(request).Result;      result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();        var responseBody = await result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);  }  ```    * In .NET Core (tested with 1.0 and 2.0), the above executes successfully.  * In .NET framework (tested with 4.7.1, 4.6.1, 4.5), the above throws a `ProtocolViolationException` with the message `Cannot send a content-body with this verb-type` on the `SendAsync` call.    While I am very happy that Core allows this (technically correct, but unusual) request type, I am less happy that the Framework does not support it. Why does Core allow this why Framework does not? Is this intentional or an oversight? Is there somewhere where these differences/idiosyncrasies are documented?    (For another example of differing HTTP behaviour in Core vs Framework, [see this issue](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp/issues/607#issuecomment-345596448).)    -----  _@AppBeat writes -_  Interesting. According to this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/978061/http-get-with-request-body  standard does not explicitly forbid this. GET body should be ignored by server.    -----  _@IanKemp writes -_  @AppBeat The server is free to ignore or accept the body; that should not prevent the client from sending a request that the server may ignore. It is ultimately up to the client to determine whether the server accepts requests like this.    A popular example of a product (server) that supports GET requests with bodies is Elasticsearch, [specifically their REST query API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_empty_search.html). In particular, the section on that page ""A GET Request with a Body?"" explains their rationale (but note that they do also allow POST as a fallback option for clients that do not support this).    ----  _@AppBeat writes -_   I didn't say that this should be removed from .NET Core :) Although this is not common (bad?) practice I think .NET Core version in this case is more correct than .NET Framework implementation.    I will try to test this on new managed implementation of SocketsHttpHandler which will probably be prefered HttpHandler in future for more consistent behaviour across all different platforms.  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/SocketsHttpHandler    I created new functional test for SocketsHttpHandler and it works as it should:    ```  [Fact]  public async Task SendAsync_HttpGetWithPayload_Success()  {      await LoopbackServer.CreateServerAsync(async (server, url) =>      {          string responseBody =              ""HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"" +              $""Date: {DateTimeOffset.UtcNow:R}\r\n"" +              ""Content-Length: 0\r\n"" +              ""Connection: close\r\n"" +              ""\r\n"";            using (HttpClient client = CreateHttpClient())          {              var request = new HttpRequestMessage              {                  RequestUri = url,                  Method = HttpMethod.Get,              };                request.Content = new StringContent(""{}"", Encoding.UTF8, ""application/json"");              Task<HttpResponseMessage> getResponseTask = client.SendAsync(request);              await server.AcceptConnectionAsync(async connection =>              {                  Task<List<string>> serverTask = connection.ReadRequestHeaderAndSendCustomResponseAsync(responseBody);                  await TestHelper.WhenAllCompletedOrAnyFailed(getResponseTask, serverTask);              });                Assert.True(getResponseTask.IsCompletedSuccessfully);              var result = getResponseTask.Result;              Assert.True(result.IsSuccessStatusCode);          }      });  }  ```"

28132	area-System.Runtime	Get the .NET Core version number at runtime	@IvanFarkas commented on [Sat Jan 27 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1242)  Is there a reliable way to get the **.NET Core version number** at runtime that works on **Nano Server** and **Ubuntu** **Docker** containers as well, please?  I've seen some hacks deriving it from folder structure that breaks when the app is deployed onto Nano Server and Ubuntu Docker container images.  
28131	area-System.Net	Span Support for Socket SendTo and UdpClient 	Checking out the new Span based socket apis in 2.1 preview 1, I noticed the api of UdpClient doesn't have span based overloads.      Falling back to Socket, it appears there too the SendTo api is missing any overloads for Span and friends.      Digging deeper into [SocketPal.Windows](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketPal.Windows.cs#L203-L238), there's no SendTo supporting span there but [SocketPal.Unix](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/SocketPal.Unix.cs#L706-L750) does seem to have some Span support.      The corresponding receive methods are also lacking Span support.      To add actual non-allocating support, it would also appear that endpoint serialization in these methods would need to be tweaked but that seems to be somewhat the point of [SocketAddress](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/Common/src/System/Net/SocketAddress.cs) so maybe calling code would need to pass the SocketAddress instead of the IPEndPoint/EndPoint?    Was this an intentional gap in the api or just something that wasn't priority / low use case?

I've manually tested against my personal OneDrive folder to validate the behavior.
28123	area-System.Collections	Flag unprotected concurrent dictionary access	"`Dictionary<K, V>` is not threadsafe for concurrent access involving writes. If this occurs the datastructure can get corrupted and more and more threads can get ""captured"" inside `FindEntry` or `TryInsert` (or certain other methods), looping continously until the process terminates. `HashSet<T>` has a similar backing datastructure and can similarly ""capture"" threads inside `AddIfNotPresent` (or one of several other methods).    [Aside on how these work: lookups in these datastructures use hashing into a `_buckets` array to find an index into the `_entries` array (named `_slots` in `HashSet<T>`). If there is no hash collision that `Entry` (`Slot`) contains the sought after entry. If there is a collision on that hash, it begins a chain, and lookup follows the chain. If the desired entry is not present in the collection then the chain should terminate in an empty entry and the method returns (possibly after adding the entry). When entries are added, they are prepended to this chain and `_buckets` and then `_entries` are fixed up. After removes, unused slots are kept in a free chain with a head is stored in `_freelist` to avoid needing to scan `_entries` for unused slots. Concurrent updates to these chains (or possibly concurrent traverse and write) can lead to loops at which point any read or write can potentially be sucked into a busy loop.]    Although this always indicates a bug in the calling code we have now seen this impact several large services and it can cause expensive and growing CPU monopolization until much or all of the host machine is looping endlessly. Given that we should consider whether there is a cheap way that we can flag buggy callers and throw, similar to how we maintain a `version` counter purely to flag buggy callers.    @vancem suggested a check could be done only on insert/remove (ie write), so there would be no perf impact on readers."

28119	area-System.Net	HttpClient can sometime take long time to get response	"This was originally reported by @avanderhoorn. According to their telemetry  some simple requests are taking more than 30s to complete:    > We have an issue where around 2.75% of our Http Client requests to the server are taking longer than 5s and around 1% take longer than 20s.  >    > Normally this wouldn’t be that hard to track down, but unfortunately in all cases the server is saying that it responded in under 1.5s, 2s at the absolute most (note this finding is consistent between app level and nginx telemetry), yet the client is reporting very different figures.  >    > Looking at the data, this issue seems to happen statically more on a Mac than it does on windows (data since Thurs):  > 5s>  > Win        74 machines, 142 hits  > Mac       156 machines, 639 hits  > 20s >  > Win        16 machines, 36 hits  > Mac       110 machines, 199 hits  > All  > Win        1102 machines, 11683 hits  > Mac       1130 machines, 16991 hits    After some investigation it seems like this is caused by using stalled connection from connection pool.   The basic repro is to make HTTP request, wait 5+ minutes and do do another request.  When second request goes out write to socket buffer succeeds and client waits Timeout for response. TCP stack keeps retransmitting data and it will eventually fail ~ 30s on OSX.       ``` c#  using System;  using System.Threading;  using System.Threading.Tasks;  using System.Net.Http;  using System.Diagnostics;    namespace osx  {      class Program      {            static public async Task Run()          {              var httpClient = new HttpClient()              {                  BaseAddress = new Uri(""https://insiders.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com/"")              };                var runCount = 1;              var timeoutIncrement = 30000;              var timeout = 390000; //6.5min                while (true)              {                  Console.WriteLine($""Run: {runCount++} ({timeout})"");                    var timer = Stopwatch.StartNew();                  try                  {                      var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, $""/api/v0.2/workspace/a{runCount}"");                      var response = await httpClient.SendAsync(request);                      Console.WriteLine($""\tStatus: {(int)response.StatusCode} - {response.RequestMessage.RequestUri.AbsoluteUri}"");                      response = null;                  }                  catch (Exception e)                  {                      timer.Stop();                      Console.WriteLine($""\tError: {timer.ElapsedMilliseconds} - {e.ToString()}"");                      Console.ReadLine();                  }                    timer.Stop();                  Console.WriteLine($""\tCompleted: {timer.ElapsedMilliseconds}"");                    Thread.Sleep(timeout);                  timeout += timeoutIncrement;              }          }              static void Main(string[] args)          {              Console.WriteLine(""Hello World!"");               Run().GetAwaiter().GetResult();               Console.WriteLine(""All DONE"");          }      }  }  ```  The server uses Azure load-ballancer and it will drop idle connections after while without sending FIN, RST or ICMP. This is similar to behavior of some firewalls.    Using code above it is trivial to reproduce on OSX with 2.0 core. 2.1 with curl handler has same issue.  On Ubuntu 16 the code above does not repro.  Client starts sending keep-alive probes after 75s and connection fails before next attempt happen. (at least with current repro and firewall setting)   Note that there may be differences between versions as there is nothing explicit HttpClient does to make it happen.    On Windows 10, we seems to drop the connection after being idle for 60s and the delay does not repro. This can be perhaps impacted by version or OS setting. Telemetry show predominant failures on Windows 7.      I also tested this with 2.1 and HttpSocketHandler. It does not repro as we retire connection from pool after 2 minutes. I have not seen any attempts for keep-alive and the problem could re-surface if default timeout is increased on pool or if there is more aggressive firewall cleanup.   This would probably be good thing to consider.     As workaround one can use ""Connection: close"" header or stop reusing connection pooling.                  "

Note: We will keep fixing 2.1 issues after that, until the final release (exact dates are not announced yet), but hopefully not in large masses.    We would like to encourage and ask our contributors to help us drive towards that goal. **Be part of .NET Core 2.1 release!**    How can you, the CoreFX contributors, help?  1. If you're picking up issues to work on, **prefer issues marked as [2.1.0 bugs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3A2.1.0)** (some are even [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3A2.1.0%20label%3Aup-for-grabs)).  2.

Conversely if there's something in 2.1 that is not as significant as it seems.      * We strive to deliver high-quality product, so **impactful bugs, compatibility, reliability and performance issues** are top priority. We want to be highly compatible with .NET Core 2.0.      * Adding additional new APIs, fixing pre-existing bugs or fixing corner-case issues with lower impact and with existing workaround is lower priority, not tracked as 2.1. We will delay such contributions until master branch reopens for post-2.1 work (early April).  3. Issues with [no milestone](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20no%3Amilestone) - we expect to set their milestone by end of week (part of ongoing ""triage""), so if you see something must-have for 2.1 there, please say so and explain why (loop in @karelz).  4. Watch for upcoming official preview announcements (on [.NET blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/) or on [dotnet/Announcements repo](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements)) to help validate and dogfood the end-to-end .NET Core 2.1 experience before final release.      * You can start with [.NET Core 2.1 Preview 1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/02/27/announcing-net-core-2-1-preview-1/) released on Feb 27.      * You can also dogfood our daily builds - see [dogfooding steps](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dogfooding.md)    Not surprisingly, to deliver overall end-to-end .NET Core 2.1 experience, similar ZBB efforts happen in our sister repos like [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), etc. - we will welcome help in those as well, if you're interested.

28105	area-System.Net	WinHttpHandler: Check available credentials when choosing authentication scheme	When choosing what authentication scheme to use, WinHttpHandler picks the most secure scheme supported by the server. When the client does not support this scheme it closes the connection. We need to instead pick the most secure scheme offered by the server and supported by the client.    The incorrect behavior occurs under the following conditions:   - There are at least two authentication schemes enabled on the server.   - The user only provides credentials that have an authentication scheme less secure than the most secure option offered by the server.    In the conditions described in the original report, the user provides NTLM credentials, but the server supports both NTLM and Negotiate (which is considered more secure). WinHttpHandler erroneously chooses to attempt authentication with Negotiate. When we later detect that there are no credentials in the cache that support Negotiate, we close the connection.    The fix is a simple change to `WinHttpAuthHelper`, and an additional test. There is an open issue tracking auth problems with Windows Nano, so depending on the results in CI I may disable the test there.    Fixes: #27672

28100	area-System.Reflection	Using System.Reflection.TypeExtensions.GetProperties in .NET Core 2.0	"I am using a Class Library project, whose target frameworks are `net451` and `netstandard1.6`, which dynamically compiles a class in a way similar to the example here (a ""standard"" way to do the compilation):    https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/16211#issuecomment-372998985    but inside a method in `MyClass`, I want to retrieve all public properties like this (the actual code is the string of this, which is passed to `CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText`:  ```csharp  using System;  public class MyClass  {      public static void Print()      {  #if NET451              var props = this.GetType().GetProperties(System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public);  #else              var props = System.Reflection.TypeExtensions.GetProperties(this.GetType(), System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public);  #endif               //additional code      }     }  ```  Now, the Class Library project is referenced by an ASP.NET Core web app (assume any third party app that I have no control over), which targets `netcore1.1` and as [`System.Reflection.TypeExtensions.GetProperties` is available](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.typeextensions.getproperties?view=netcore-1.1#System_Reflection_TypeExtensions_GetProperties_System_Type_System_Reflection_BindingFlags_), it is working as expected.    However, targeting `netcore2.0` throws an error although it looks like the [method should still be available](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.typeextensions.getproperties?view=netcore-2.0#System_Reflection_TypeExtensions_GetProperties_System_Type_System_Reflection_BindingFlags_). The alternative (used for `net451` above):  ```csharp  var props = this.GetType().GetProperties(System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public);  ```  is actually working for `netcore2.0`, but not for `netcore1.0` or `netcore1.1`. Also note that this happens only when compiling the class dynamically - using the `MyClass`s `Print` method definition works OK in both `netcore1.0` and `netcore2.0` without the dynamic compilation.    Can you provide more information why this is happening and if it is required for the `netcore2.0` project to ""provide"" the `System.Reflection.TypeExtensions` package?"

Zero-bytes receives are used on servers to avoid allocating memory to idle connections.  The zero-byte receive returns when the socket becomes readable.

28067	area-System.Runtime	StringBuilder Insert causes suboptimal memory allocation	See https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27625#issuecomment-369791334 for full discussion.     https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16926 fixes the major problem which is unbounded growth. However in #27625 it's also observed that Insert has a potentially suboptimal chunk use strategy:    Insert does not try hard to reuse space (it won't shuffle along more than 32 characters) so it's fairly easy to end up prepending a new block.     Those prepended blocks are made only as big as needed but no less than the default of 16. So Inserts of less than 16 leave slack space that will remain unused unless there are more inserts into that chunk no more than 16 from the end of it so that its contents get shuffled along. If there's an insert at the end of that block it will create a new block rather than writing to the dead area. eg given  `|0123456789012345|` (where | is block end) inserting `0123456789` leaves us with `|0123456789......|0123456789012345|` . This leaves 6 array entries permanently dead unless there is another insert after the 10th character.    Still one could argue it is optimizing for inserting directly after the last insert rather than at the front again. However it doesn't do that either as then inserting `abc` at offset 10 gives us `|0123456789......|abc.............|0123456789012345|` rather than `|0123456789abc..|0123456789012345|` as you might expect.    Two potential changes to make here    * When insert pre-pends a new first chunk, consider writing the characters to the end of the chunk rather than the start of it since it's probably more likely that a subsequent Insert would be at index 0 rather than index n+1.   (As for insert adding interior chunks, I do not know whether the behavior is better one way or the other)    * Insert should certainly write to slack space before making a new block.    StringBuilder is intentionally heavily optimized for Append not Insert and it's already complex. Any changes to improve Insert must not impair Append nor make the implementation even more complex.    
28066	area-System.Net	[wcf.stress]: SocketsHttpHandler has worse perf than WinHttpHandler w/ https and HttpClientCredentialType:Windows	"[EDIT: Numbers below were obtained with debug build and do not reflect the difference between the release builds]    The settings for this issue were:  ```  Test:HelloWorld Binding:Https HttpClientCredentialType:Windows BindingSecurityMode:Transport  ```    Summary:    SocketsHttpHandler:    - StressLevel:1,  StressRunDuration:8  No IOException, no pool recycle, single work reported 500  - StressLevel:4, StressRunDuration: 8  Various IOException, no pool recycle, each work reported 100    WinHttpHandler:    - StressLevel:1, StressRunDuration:8  Few clr exceptions right at start (~20) no more after, 1 pool recycle, single work reported 1900  - StressLevel:4, StressRunDuration: 8  More clr exceptions right at start (seems proportional to the number of workers) no more after, 1 pool recycle, each work reported 600    So roughly WinHttpHandler can perform 4x more work for single worker and 6x more for 4 workers when Binding:Https HttpClientCredentialType:Windows.

28064	area-System.Collections	Proposal: ImmutableArray.UnsafeFreeze<T>(T[])	Use case: efficiently creating an `ImmutableArray` with a fixed (>4) number of elements.    Presently if you need to create an `ImmutableArray<T>` with a known collection of elements, the most efficient way to do so is to create an `ImmutableArray<T>.Builder`, set its `Capacity` to allocate an array of the correct size, fill the `Builder` with repeated calls to `Add`, and then use `MoveToImmutable` to create the `ImmutableArray`. (This strategy can be marginally improved by storing a cached `Builder` in a `ThreadLocal`.)    For element counts smaller than 4, there are [overloads of `ImmutableArray.Create`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/99d4271b02b4b0408fa0879651d964bebd3c5cf1/src/System.Collections.Immutable/src/System/Collections/Immutable/ImmutableArray.cs#L85) which are implemented by creating an array and then immediately turning it into an `ImmutableArray`, but for more than 4 `Create` takes a `params[]` and [copies it](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/99d4271b02b4b0408fa0879651d964bebd3c5cf1/src/System.Collections.Immutable/src/System/Collections/Immutable/ImmutableArray.cs#L157) into an `ImmutableArray`. There is no way to create an array directly, fill it, and freeze it into an `ImmutableArray` without copying while pinky-promising never to mutate the original array again.    I set up a microbenchmark (see below) which uses codegen to call `ImmutableArray<T>`'s private `T[]` constructor, and it's around 4-5 times faster for an array of 1000 `long`s. I found that a library of mine was spending a reasonable chunk of its time creating `ImmutableArray`s, and [implementing this hack](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/Eighty/commit/92a84c826b00a61158a5d17a50e88fb8c925c37a) led to a global ~10% speedup in my end-to-end benchmarks. I'm not entirely happy about depending upon private implementation details like that though.    I propose adding a officially-supported static method to freeze an array into an `ImmutableArray` without copying it. I suggest calling it `UnsafeFreeze` to emphasise the fact that this method is risky: to use it correctly you have to make sure never to mutate the array that you passed in. (This name may be confusing given that it doesn't have anything to do with C#'s `unsafe`; I'm open to alternative suggestions.)    ```csharp  public static class ImmutableArray  {      [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]      // might wanna add [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]      public static ImmutableArray<T> UnsafeFreeze<T>(T[] array)          => new ImmutableArray<T>(array);  }  ```    There may be a use case for a similar `UnsafeThaw` method which turns an `ImmutableArray<T>` into a `T[]` without copying, but I can't think of one right now.    NB. There is precedent in the BCL for APIs which ask you to relinquish ownership of the argument. `ArrayPool.Return` requires you not to continue using the array you returned because it is liable to get handed out to a future caller of `Rent`.    ----------    Here's the code for the microbenchmark I mentioned above (using BenchmarkDotNet):    ```csharp  public class Bench  {      static readonly ThreadLocal<ImmutableArray<long>.Builder> _cachedBuilder = new ThreadLocal<ImmutableArray<long>.Builder>(ImmutableArray.CreateBuilder<long>);      static readonly Func<long[], ImmutableArray<long>> _unsafeFreeze = GetUnsafeFreeze<long>();        [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]      public void CachedBuilder()      {          var builder = _cachedBuilder.Value;          builder.Capacity = 1000;          for (long i = 0; i < builder.Capacity; i++)          {              builder.Add(i);          }          builder.MoveToImmutable();      }      [Benchmark]      public void UnsafeFreeze()      {          var array = new long[1000];          for (long i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)          {              array[i] = i;          }          _unsafeFreeze(array);      }        static Func<T[], ImmutableArray<T>> GetUnsafeFreeze<T>()      {          var ctor = typeof(ImmutableArray<T>)              .GetConstructors(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance)              .Single(c => c.GetParameters().Count() == 1 && c.GetParameters().Single().ParameterType.Equals(typeof(T[])));          var param = Expression.Parameter(typeof(T[]));          var body = Expression.New(ctor, param);          var func = Expression.Lambda<Func<T[], ImmutableArray<T>>>(body, param);          return func.Compile();      }  }  ```    And the results:  ```          Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |  -------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|   CachedBuilder | 8.439 us | 0.1667 us | 0.4089 us |   1.00 |     0.00 |    UnsafeFreeze | 1.944 us | 0.0399 us | 0.1169 us |   0.23 |     0.02 |  ```

28061	area-System.Data	SqlConnection fails to reliably keep long-running connection open	This issue affects applications such as SQL Operations Studio which have long-running connections (e.g. backing a T-SQL Editor) based on the .Net Core stack. On the .Net Full stack, the connection reliably stays open or reports as non-open in the ConnectionState, allowing the application to reopen as needed. However on the .Net Core stack the state is shown as Open but on attempting any command the command will attempt to run for ~60sec, then fail with an error message    > A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 35 - An internal exception was caught)    This has a high impact on reliability of tools build on top of .Net Core for SqlClient usage.    **Related issue:** https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlopsstudio/issues/870.     **Diagnosis by @saurabh500 **:  Windows impl of SqlClient sets some Keepalive values which Unix stack doesn’t   SqlClient should set the keep alive values.     **Original issue details**:  - SQL Operations Studio Version: Feb release & latest from master    Steps to Reproduce:  - Use a macOS machine, such as the one owned by @twright-msft. Not all machines will work (mine is super-reliable for instance)  - Run a query against any DB  - Walk away for 30min  - Re-run the query    **Expected**:  - Query executes 2nd time around    **Actual**:  - Executing... spins for ~1minute, then we get an error message in the batch stating     - Note that even if we could just get a quick failure in a way where we could then close & reopen the connection that'd be OK. It's the lack of reliability plus a long wait that's making this quite bad.    > A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 35 - An internal exception was caught)    - If you are running 2 batches, you may see another message:    > Query failed: BeginExecuteReader requires an open and available Connection. The connection's current state is open.    Note that we're actually checking if the connection isn't open but this isn't reliable when it comes to TCP sockets closing. This may well be a driver-side issue, but any fix/workaround we can apply would be good.    Here's our code to close & reopen on issues:  ```C#          private void VerifyConnectionOpen(DbConnection connection)          {              if (connection == null)              {                  // Ignore this connection                  return;              }                 if (connection.State != ConnectionState.Open)              {                  // Note: this will fail and throw to the caller if something goes wrong.                  // This seems the right thing to do but if this causes serviceability issues where stack trace                  // is unexpected, might consider catching and allowing later code to fail. But given we want to get                  // an opened connection for any action using this, it seems OK to handle in this manner                  ClearPool(connection);                  connection.Open();              }          }  ```    We can add connection.Close() in this case which _might_ fix issues where connection is in a broken state, but definitely doesn't fix the error all up.

28058	area-System.IO	DeflateStream decompression throughput is dependent on size of internal buffer	We have an internal buffer in `DeflateStream` and its size has significant impact on the throughput of the API.  Currently this buffer is defined by DefaultBufferSize which is [fixed at 8KB](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/3fca26cedf6c54aabc100e69106fc7e263db7815/src/System.IO.Compression/src/System/IO/Compression/DeflateZLib/DeflateStream.cs#L16)    This was brought to my attention by some partner code that re-implemented DeflateStream to get better performance.  The primary difference in their implementation was the size of the backing buffer.    A simple fix would be to expose our buffer size.  Here's a change that does so:  https://github.com/ericstj/corefx/commit/423b9bb0644a432ac565ec1382b571a28012ab8b    I measured our performance in relation to this using a [benchmark](https://gist.github.com/ericstj/0651461ac37b1420097f285148c59c80) (partner code removed).  Here's the result:  ```                 Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev |  --------------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|       <partner-stream> | 26.52 ms | 0.5310 ms | 0.9159 ms |   DeflateStreamDefault | 42.59 ms | 0.8534 ms | 1.2239 ms |      DeflateStream32kb | 27.21 ms | 0.5415 ms | 0.5318 ms |     DeflateStream128kb | 24.76 ms | 0.4891 ms | 0.6007 ms |     DeflateStream512kb | 22.09 ms | 0.2712 ms | 0.2265 ms |    DeflateStream1024kb | 22.86 ms | 0.4036 ms | 0.3775 ms |  ```    Now this may not be the only / best solution but it does put control in the hands of the caller.  Other things to consider might be some internal heuristic, pipelines, or even exposing the backing DEFLATE alogrithm as [was done with Brotli](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/25785).

28056	area-System.Text	Regex.Split with RegexOptions.RightToLeft implementation/documentation behavior	"I wonder if the current Regex.Split implementation when using in combination with RegexOptions.RightToLeft is what a user would expect. See the below example:     ```csharp  > Regex.Split(""111-a1b2-111"", @""a(\d)b(\d)"")  string[4] { ""111-"", ""1"", ""2"", ""-111"" }  > Regex.Split(""111-a1b2-111"", @""a(\d)b(\d)"", RegexOptions.RightToLeft)  string[4] { ""111-"", ""2"", ""1"", ""-111"" }  ```    The only difference is that the capture groups, if some are used are evaluated from right to left, but not the matches themselves. That's because in the implementation the list of string is reversed at the end but the capture groups are added always from left to right (for loop): (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Text.RegularExpressions/src/System/Text/RegularExpressions/Regex.Split.cs#L158).    The docs state the following (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-options#right-to-left-mode)  > The RegexOptions.RightToLeft option changes the search direction only; it does not interpret the regular expression pattern from right to left.    That could indicate that the current behavior is fine but that with this rule an iterator implementation is not possible because you would already need the last result (the first from left to right) when you just got the first result (the last from left to right). I think the only way to implement an iterator here is to change the behavior to return the results right to left when RegexOptions.RightToLeft is chosen.    cc @vancem @danmosemsft @jkotas @stephentoub @terrajobst @joshfree "

Whereas, on .NET Framework and Mono, the `XAttribute` serialization uses a reduced format where the "".0000000"" are not present.

28046	area-System.Collections	Support struct Enumerator for ConcurrentDictionary	ConcurrentDictionary enables enumerating the dictionary while other threads are modifying it, making it very useful in a variety of scenarios.  But its GetEnumerator allocates an enumerator object.  We can't change the return type of GetEnumerator, but we can at least expose an enumerator struct to enable enumeration without allocating.    Proposal:  ```C#  namespace System.Collections.Concurrent  {      public class ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>      {          public IEnumerator<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> GetEnumerator(); // existing            public struct Enumerator // new          {              public Enumerator(ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue> dictionary);              public bool MoveNext();              public KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> Current { get; }          }      }  }  ```    Example usage:  ```C#  private static ConcurrentDictionary<string, int> s_dict = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, int>();  ...  var enumerator = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, int>.Enumerator(s_dict);  while (enumerator.MoveNext())  {      Use(enumerator.Current);  }  ```
28045	area-System.Net	Need a thread-safe/scalable credential cache for use in System.Net.Http	HttpClientHandler implementations supporting preauthenticate currently use a CredentialCache to store credentials, but CredentialCache is not thread-safe, and since requests might be modifying the cache, all access to it needs to be locked.  That means when preauthenticate is enabled, every request needs to take the same lock while accessing the cache to see if it contains credentials for use in that request.
28044	area-System.Memory	ReadOnlySequence constructor validation issues	`public ReadOnlySequence(ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T> startSegment, int startIndex, ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T> endSegment, int endIndex)` constructor does not validate some issues.    I suggest to add next validations:    1. `endSegment.RunningIndex < 0`  to validate that endSegment.RunningIndex not negative.    2. `startSegment != endSegment && (ulong)startSegment.RunningIndex > (ulong)endSegment.RunningIndex - startSegment.Memory.Length`  to validate that startSegment.RunningIndex not negative  and startSegment.RunningIndex + startSegment.Memory.Length <= endSegment.RunningIndex (validate correct order of startSegment and endSegment).    3. Should we check that end is reachable and all `RunningIndex` are correct?    4. Also this constructor throw `ThrowArgumentValidationException` exception without endIndex parameter.  `ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentValidationException(startSegment, startIndex, endSegment);`  I think it should be  `ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentValidationException(startSegment, startIndex, endSegment, endIndex);`  If so then `ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentValidationException` message should be changed also.

28040	area-System.Memory	API Proposal: Helper to get ReadOnlySpan<char> from string with terminator	In some cases we want null terminated spans of char (interop for example). There isn't a convenient helper to get a span from a string with the terminator included.    ``` diff  namespace System  {      public static partial class MemoryExtensions      {          public static ReadOnlySpan<char> AsSpan(this string text);  +       public static ReadOnlySpan<char> AsSpanWithTerminator(this string text);       }  }  ```    This is useful when you want to take a ReadOnlySpan<char> as a parameter that you then need to pass to something (notably a native API) that expects a null terminated string. We can easily validate that we have a null and not have to copy.    ``` C#  public static void Foo(ReadOnlySpan<char> bar)  {      if (bar.Length > 0 && bar[bar.Length - 1] == '\0')      {          NativeFoo(ref MemoryMarshal.GetReference(path));      }      else      {          // make a copy, add a null, and call NativeFoo()      }  }  ```    ** Notes **    - Perhaps this should live in `MemoryMarshal` as it is a little more advanced? It isn't a terribly difficult concept though.  - Should also return default if passed null for string.    cc: @KrzysztofCwalina, @terrajobst, @ahsonkhan, @jkotas

28033	area-System.Threading	Ensuring order in case of exception in System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow blocks	Dataflow blocks shut down in case of an exception, but a few more items may get propagated before actual completion, including items that appeared after the faulty one in the input sequence.  I may provide a few lines of code to show this, but looking at the source code it seems this is intended. I don't get the rationale of this behavior: skipping a faulty item but propagating a few subsequent ones seems at odd with the (very useful) ordering guarantee that all blocks provide by default.    In my use case, for example, I process items (file lines) with some degree of parallelism in a transform block, linked to a (sequential) action block in charge of storing a kind of 'commit point'.  In case of an error I'd like to restart from the previously saved commit point, skipping most of the input lines already processed but still ensuring 'at least once' processing.    I think that items following a faulty one should not be propagated.

28025	area-System.Threading	Blazing-Fast replacement for the System.Threading.Task.Dataflow (as an extension to System.Threading.Channels)	"@dmitriyse commented on [Mon Mar 12 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/issues/2154)    The problem.  ---  When you developing DotNet application that should handle more than 10k+ items/sec on a single ServerNode, You are facing with DotNet framework botlenecks and app architecture bottlenecks.    System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow solves the architecture problems. It's allows to decouple operations from a async/awaits processing chains and balance processing with help of queues between operations blocks.    For example if you have 10 processing blocks and wants to have 10k+ items/sec final performance, than the communication speed between each opration block should be greater that 100k+ items/sec and   1M+ items/sec to get framework overhead less than 10%.    Unfortunately current CoreFX API was not designed for 1M+ Operation/sec performance and full reimplementation of subsystems is required.    When we summarize all overheads:  1) System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow overheads  2) TPL overheads  3) Synchrnization overheads (lock or Interlocked are cheap but not cost-free and in fully async cases it's called too many times). Even lock-free collections which are based on ""LOCK CMPXCHG"" assmbly instruction eats big amount CPU time (especially in a NUMA environments).   4) Array allocations/ memory copying  5) Async/Await methods state machines overheads  6) etc.    Final overhead in the best case allows to handle 10k+ items, but with 100% of framework overhead with no room to application logic.    This proposal perfectly fits into the roadmap https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md  When the ""PROCESSING"" block is not empty, DotNet moves down from 10th place to ~50th.    The solution approaches.  ----  1) Use batch mode communication between Processing Blocks  2) Avoid memory copying and allocation where it's possible (zero-copy and buffer pooling approaches)  3) Design API with keeping optimization in mind in every method signature  4) Do something with TPL (in CoreCLR 2.1 will already have a new IValueTaskSource approach that reduces TPL overhead)  5) Use Event-loops with TPL API adoption and faster Non-TPL API, (this is separate issue dotnet/corefxlab#2168). Workflows sharded across multiple event-loops can dramatically reduce synchronization performance leaks.    The new API proposal.  ---  CoreFX now has the new API System.Threading.Channels which contains the abstractions and base implementation for async friendly queues as a replacement for synchronous thread-safe BlockingCollection and ConcurrentQueue.  Also System.Threading.Channels API is a partial replacement for the System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow async friendly queues (which is implicitly implemented inside BufferBlock and other blocks).    We can extend System.Threading.Channels API to get more feature complete alternative to the System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow:    1) Replace Task with ValueTask in the ChannelReader/ChannelWriter  2) Make contracts IChannelReader/IChannelWriter as a first-class abstractions (instead of abstract classes ChannelReader/ChannelWriter)   3) Add a rich set of batch mode methods to IChannelReader/IChannelWriter with zero-copy, with copy and with buffer ownership and passthrough of buffers from a writer to a reader as is.  4) Instead of Channel<TReader, TWriter> introduce interfaces IDataFlowSource<T> and IDataFlowTarget<T>   5) Implement common types of Buffers with rich options set (for example read aggregation amount/timeout)  6) Implement some shaper/load balancer solutions that helps to balance the load among executors.  7) Implement new contracts in some other API (probably Pipes) and adaptors to old well-known API    IDataFlowConsumer/IDataFlowProducer :  ``` CSharp      /// <summary>      /// The data flow consumer.      /// </summary>      /// <typeparam name=""T"">Specifies the type of data that may be written to the consumer.</typeparam>      public interface IDataFlowConsumer<T>      {          /// <summary>          /// Opens the new writer.          /// </summary>          /// <remarks>          /// Producer can use some load balancing logic between known open writers.

28024	area-System.Net	ClientWebSocket should always use CONNECT tunneling thru a proxy	While working on https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26957, I noticed that WS (websocket non-secure) connections thru a proxy don't use CONNECT tunneling. Instead, they appear to be using just a fully qualified GET request thru the proxy.    This differs from .NET Framework and .NET Core 2.0 (originally used WinHTTP).  In order to maximize success with websocket connections thru proxies, .NET Framework and other stacks typically always use CONNECT tunneling even if the destination server is not a TLS/SSL connection.    Using a test proxy server, I saw the following being sent to/thru the proxy:    ```  GET http://corefx-net.cloudapp.net/WebSocket/EchoWebSocket.ashx HTTP/1.1  Connection: Upgrade  Upgrade: websocket  Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13  Sec-WebSocket-Key: zmboERimu0GSCsWNRKsDZA==  Host: corefx-net.cloudapp.net  ```    It appears that ClientWebSocket is only using a CONNECT verb to the server when the destination websocket server is using the WSS (secure) connection.  In that case, we see the following thru the proxy:    ```  CONNECT corefx-net.cloudapp.net:443 HTTP/1.1  Host: corefx-net.cloudapp.net:443    Trying to connect to corefx-net.cloudapp.net  Connected to corefx-net.cloudapp.net  HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established  ```    ClientWebSocket should be fixed to always use CONNECT tunneling for all connections thru a proxy regardless of whether the websocket server is a secure connection.

28010	area-System.Runtime	[Discussion] Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-0875: Hash Collision can cause Denial of Service	# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-0875: Hash Collision can cause Denial of Service  ## Executive Summary    Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in the public versions of .NET Core 1.0 and 2.0 (including other minor and patch releases).  This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications correctly.    Microsoft is aware of a security vulnerability in the public versions of .NET Core where a malicious file or web request could cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.    System administrators are advised to update their .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.10, 1.1.7 or 2.0.6. Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.8 or 2.1.101.    ## Original Announcement    The original announcement is located at https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/62    ### Mitigation Factors    None    ### Affected Software    Any application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected.     ### Advisory FAQ  #### How do I know if I am affected?  Any application running against .NET Core 1.0.9 or lower versions, 1.1.6 or lower minor versions or 2.0.5 or lower minor versions is affected.     A complete list of runtimes can be discovered by performing a directory listing in the install root directories. The default root directories are listed in the following table:    | Operating System | Location |  |------------------|----------|  | Windows | `C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\` |  | macOS | `/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |  | Supported Linux platforms | `/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/` |    Each runtime version is installed in its own directory, where the directory name is the version number. If you don't have a directory for 1.0.10, 1.1.7 and 2.0.6, then any applications targeting the respective major/minor versions, 1.0 or 1.1 or 2.0 of .NET Core are vulnerable.    Additionally, if you've deployed self-contained applications targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be updated to target the updated .NET Core runtime, recompiled and redeployed.    #### How do I fix my affected application?    Applications can be fixed by installing the latest .NET Core runtimes or SDKs. Typically, application servers only have runtime packages installed and developer machines have the SDKs installed.   Installers for the runtimes can be downloaded from the [Runtime and SDK download archive](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archive.md).   .NET Core 1.1.8 SDK installs both versions 1.0.10 and 1.1.7 of the .NET Core runtime.    If you've built a self-contained application, you must install the new runtime and SDK, update your application to target the updated .NET Core runtime, recompile and redeploy. To update your runtime version edit the `RuntimeFrameworkVersion` property in the project's .csproj file to indicate the desired target version. For example:    ```xml  <PropertyGroup>    <RuntimeFrameworkVersion>2.0.6</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>  </PropertyGroup>  ```    #### What if the update breaks my application?  An application can be pinned to a previous version of the runtime by editing the `{applicationName}.runtimeconfig.json` file for that application., where `{applicationName}` is the name of the executable, for example `example.exe` would have a runtime configuration file titled `example.runtimeconfig.json`. Set the framework version to the desired version and the `rollForward` property to false. These settings should be treated as a temporary measure and the application updated to work with the patched versions of the framework.    Since the `{applicationName}.runtimeconfig.json` file is an optional file, you may need to create one for each application and add it alongside the executable.    ### Acknowledgments  [Ben Adams](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams) of [Illyriad Games](https://www.illyriad.co.uk/)    ### External Links  [CVE-2018-0875](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0875)    ### Revisions    V1.2 (Mar 26, 2018): Corrected instructions for runtimeconfig.json  V1.1 (Mar 14, 2018): Added instructions for self contained application retargetting.

28009	area-System.Text	RFC: MARK in Regular Expressions	"First of all, I'm hoping that this is the right place to post this.    [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49256716/regex-mark-to-see-which-capture-group-was-matched) is the original StackOverflow post.    There's this neat little `MARK` keyword in the PCRE Regex specification:  https://pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html#SEC23    https://3v4l.org/ErCrp  ```php  <?php    $string = 'true';  $matches = [];    preg_match('~(?|true(*:1)                 |false(*:1)                 |\d+(*:2))~x', $string, $matches);    // *MARK:1 stands for a boolean  // *MARK:2 stands for a integer literal    var_dump($matches);    //> array(2) {   //>     [0]=> string(4) ""true""   //>     [""MARK""]=> string(1) ""1""   //> }     $token = new Token(      $lexeme = $matches[0],      $type = $matches['MARK']  );  ```    As you can see, `MARK` allows you to understand which group matched, not just if it was matched. In this example `MARK` would contain the token type which would make tokenizing mind blowingly elegant.    Unfortunately, right now I have to create capture groups and then manually check which capture group was matched when.    ```csharp  var pattern = @""(      (?<true>true)      |(?<false>false)      |(?<integer>\d+)  )"";    var regexOptions = RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture | RegexOptions.IgnorePatternWhitespace;  var regex = new Regex(pattern, regexOptions);  var matches = regex.Matches(""true"");    foreach (Match match in matches)  {      int? mark = null;        if (match.Groups[""true""].Success || match.Groups[""false""].Success)      {          mark = 1;      }      else if (match.Groups[""integer""].Success)      {          mark = 2;      }  }  ```    I mean, it works. But this will have to be repeated for every symbol, every operator, everything. Since the regex engine already knows what happened it should be able to report it back.    Do you see any use in this feature?"

28001	area-System.Memory	Proposal: Add support for ROS comparison with specified culture	```csharp  namespace System  {      public static partial class MemoryExtensions      {          public static int CompareTo(this ReadOnlySpan<char> span, ReadOnlySpan<char> value, CultureInfo culture, CompareOptions options);      }  }  ```    ### Rationale    While doing some Span optimizations in Regex I noticed that the current comparison extension methods on ROS don't support comparison with a specific culture: `MemoryExtensions.CompareTo(this ReadOnlySpan<char> span, ReadOnlySpan<char> value, StringComparison comparisonType)`.    With string I can do that in different ways either by `string.Compare(string, string, CultureInfo, CompareOptions);` or by `StringComparer.Create(CultureInfo, bool ignoreCase).Compare(string, string)`.    Is there a specific reason that we excluded a CultureInfo overload in the extension method?    cc @tarekgh @ahsonkhan

27988	area-System.Net	CurlHandler: Remove Transfer-Encoding on redirect from POST to GET	This fix removes the TransferEncoding header from a request when it is redirected from POST to GET. I chose to modify the request for the following reasons:    1. It's consistent with the behavior of WinHttpHandler.  2. At this point the header has already been modified by the code linked below.    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/444e6bb7fd274be680fb3bf4b22258821e77ae2c/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/CurlHandler/CurlHandler.cs#L777-L781    I also tagged the locations where the TransferEncoding header is being modified with an issue tracking removal of those modifications.    If anyone feels strongly about not modifying the request (despite the above), I think that it is possible. It's just a much more significant rework.    Fixes: #27301
27985	area-System.Memory	Add a _malloca-like API Span<T>.Alloc(int length)	"(This is distinct from the proposal at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26954, which considers a more powerful API that can give the caller specific information about the current stack. The proposal under consideration here is only for a ""[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)"" API. Both proposals could exist side-by-side depending on the scenario, and in fact this proposal could depend on the more powerful API if we decide that's the right behavior.)    As the pattern `Span<T> span = stackalloc T[len];` becomes more commonplace, we're seeing a rise in incorrect usage where developers are piping through untrusted _len_ values, potentially making their applications susceptible to reliability issues or DoS attacks. The __safe__ language construct is `Span<T> span = ((uint)len <= 128 /* or other const */) ? stackalloc T[len] : new T[len];`. We can't rely on our larger developer audience remembering the safe pattern, and even our more knowledgeable advanced developers can forget the check from time to time.    Following are concrete proposals from the security team as to how this can be addressed.    First, create a utility method `public static Span<T> Span<T>.Alloc(int length)`. This API will `stackalloc` in the current frame if appropriate; otherwise the method will heap-alloc, similar to the CRT's [_malloca](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/malloca) API. Adding this method and getting the desired runtime behavior would not require compiler changes, but it would require JIT changes. The implementation of the method would default simply to `new T[length]` if _length_ is negative or is too large. Advanced developers who want to pull from an existing array pool as fallback wouldn't use this API; they'd perform the check manually.    Second, once the utility method is in place, the compiler should be smart enough to treat `return Span<T>.Alloc(...);` as a compile-time error, just as it does today for `Span<T> span = stackalloc T[...]; return span;`. This _would_ require a compiler change.    Third, the developer should be warned when passing a non-constant and non-bounds-checked value into `stackalloc`, and the warning should direct the developer to use `Span<T>.Alloc` instead. The developer should also be warned when using `stackalloc` or `Span<T>.Alloc` in a loop. (We considered warning on recursive method calls, but that really belongs in a different analyzer.) Making this a proper compiler warning is probably a bit too noisy, so it could be a Roslyn code analyzer instead. This wouldn't require a compiler or JIT change; it'd just be a new version of the analyzers package for developers who run it as part of build.    Finally, remember that this is a KISS proposal. It's intended for the majority use case for developers who may want to consume `Span`-based APIs but need a bit of a safety net. Advanced developers could still use the other APIs under consideration or perform their own custom checks as appropriate for their applications."

27962	area-System.Runtime	Mutating a read-only struct passed by-ref with S.R.CS.Unsafe	The value of the System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe class is in that it can do safe things that the compiler however cannot verify. For using Unsafe methods safely, it is essential that their semantics are fully understood. Currently, the methods are a bit under-documented.    One thing that seems apparently possible is mutating an instance of a read-only struct if that instance is passed by mutable reference:    ```csharp  public readonly struct Point  {      private readonly int x;      private readonly int y;        public static void Move(ref Point point, int dx, int dy)      {          Unsafe.AsRef(in point.x) += dx;          Unsafe.AsRef(in point.y) += dy;      }  }  ```    On a scale from 1 to 10, how evil is that?

Whittling things down into a standalone repro... I build a new stand alone project, added a NuGet reference to NLog.Extensions.Logging, added a NLog.config to the project which always copies to output directory, with the following contents:    ```<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?>  <nlog xmlns=""http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd""        xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"">    <targets>      <target name=""console"" xsi:type=""Console"" />    </targets>      <rules>      <logger name=""*"" minlevel=""Info"" writeTo=""console"" />    </rules>  </nlog>  ```    Then updated the Program.cs file to be the following:    ```using NLog;  using System;    namespace foo1  {      class Program      {          static Logger logger = LogManager.GetLogger(""GoingToCrash"");          static void Main(string[] args)          {              logger.Info(""Hello World!"");              new ArgumentException();              logger.Info(""Boom?"");          }      }  }  ```    When I build/publish this demo app with:    dotnet publish --runtime linux-arm --configuration Release    To my Pi2... it fails with the above stacktrace. If I follow the advice of https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26292 and add the bolded text to the rather simple csproj:    ```<Project Sdk=""Microsoft.NET.Sdk"">      <PropertyGroup>      <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>      <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>    </PropertyGroup>  ***  <PropertyGroup>      <RuntimeFrameworkVersion>2.0.5</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>    </PropertyGroup>***      <ItemGroup>      <PackageReference Include=""NLog.Extensions.Logging"" Version=""1.0.0-rtm-rc7"" />    </ItemGroup>      <ItemGroup>      <None Update=""NLog.config"">        <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>      </None>    </ItemGroup>    </Project>  ```    There is a slight improvement... it still suffers from a segmentation fault, only you don't see the stack trace.    Attached is the rather simplistic repro, which of course works fine on my Windows 10 machine, but fails on Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).

27949	area-System.Net	Option to have more control when resolving endpoint IP address in SocketsHttpHandler	I think it may be useful in some cases to have more control over endpoint address resolving.  This would be new optional feature in SocketsHttpHandler implementation. Here is my initial idea.    ## Proposed API    ```  public sealed class SocketsHttpHandler : HttpMessageHandler  {     //existing members     //...       //Proposed API     public Func<HttpRequestMessage, string, int, CancellationToken, ValueTask<IPEndPoint>> ResolveEndpointAsync {get;set;}  }  ```  where delegate inputs are:  - HttpRequestMessage -> request details  - string -> request.RequestUri.IdnHost  - int -> request.RequestUri.Port  - CancellationToken    and delegate output is:  - ValueTask\<IPEndPoint\> -> representing resolved IP address based on given input    Similar Func<> pattern is used in WinHttpHandler.ServerCertificateValidationCallback    ## Example usage    ```  socketsHttpHandlerInstance.ResolveEndpointAsync = async delegate (HttpRequestMessage request, string host, int port, CancellationToken cancellationToken)  {   var addresses = await Dns.GetHostAddressesAsync(host).ConfigureAwait(false);   //resolve hostname to IPv6   var address = addresses.Where(addr => addr.AddressFamily == AddressFamily.InterNetworkV6).FirstOrDefault();   return address != null ? new IPEndPoint(address, port) : null;  };    ```  ## Main goals  - feature is optional and should not change current behaviour in any way  - if feature is not used it should not affect existing performance    ## Possible use cases  - one could implement ResolveEndpointAsync to use Google DNS or other DNS server for resolving addresses, without changing system settings  - one could implement ResolveEndpointAsync to use round-robin for resolving IP Addresses  - better control over IPv4/IPv6 resolving  - could be used in functional testing to resolve test IP addresses    Prototype implementation: https://github.com/AppBeat/corefx  Very early PR: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27937    Kind regards,  Vladimir
27948	area-System.Memory	Deriving from OwnedMemory	"```csharp  public sealed class SafeMemoryHandle : SafeHandle  {      public static SafeMemoryHandle Alloc(UIntPtr size) => VirtualAlloc(IntPtr.Zero, size, 0x3000, 0x04);      private SafeMemoryHandle() : base(IntPtr.Zero, true) { }      public override bool IsInvalid => handle == IntPtr.Zero;      protected override bool ReleaseHandle() => VirtualFree(handle, UIntPtr.Zero, 0x8000) != 0;      [DllImport(""Kernel32.dll"")]      private static extern SafeMemoryHandle VirtualAlloc(IntPtr address, UIntPtr size, uint allocationType, uint protect);      [DllImport(""Kernel32.dll"")]      private static extern int VirtualFree(IntPtr address, UIntPtr size, uint freeType);  }  ```    A SafeHandle like this has [a number of features](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.safehandle(v=vs.110).aspx#Does):    * it has magic P/Invoke support to avoid leaks,  * it is thread-safe,  * it does reference counting, and  * disposing it doesn't release the handle until the reference count reaches 0.    Overall, very similar to OwnedMemory.    I would assume that a NativeOwnedMemory implementation should do most (all?) of this as well.    The question is: Is it envisioned that there will be implementations of OwnedMemory that are not thread-safe, not reference counting, or not delaying release when they are disposed before the reference count reaches 0? If not, shouldn't OwnedMemory provide the implementations for most of its methods and only leave allocation and release to derived classes (like SafeHandle)?    Should NativeOwnedMemory wrap a SafeHandle to get those leak preventing features or is it fine to wrap an IntPtr? Should (Native)OwnedMemory  derive from CriticalFinalizerObject?  "
27947	area-System.Memory	Does ReadOnlySequence open write access to ReadOnlyMemory?	As I see when `ReadOnlySequence` created with `ReadOnlyMemory`, it extract internal object of `ReadOnlyMemory` (`array`, `string` or `OwnedMemory`) and give access to that object throw GetPosition method.    So `ReadOnlySequence` opens access to `array` or `OwnedMemory`. But `array` or `OwnedMemory` are not read only objects and they opens write access to `ReadOnlyMemory`.  So any code can get write access to `ReadOnlyMemory` (over `array` or `OwnedMemory`) in safe code by using `ReadOnlySequence`.    Am I right? And **is it correct API design?**    Also I does not understand benefits of using `ReadOnlySequence` that contains only one segment. If your use only one segment you can use `ReadOnlyMemory` or `string` or `OwnedMemory` directly.    So I think that all one segment optimizations are usefulness because they drawback performance for `ReadOnlySequence`  with few segments.

27935	area-System.Console	Don't dup stdin & stderr as this can break some std io redicection code	_From @TheLastRar on March 10, 2018 13:8_  Consider a program that does the follow;    Create pipes and dup2 the write fd onto stdin, stderr,   Have a thread continually read the pipes until EOF is reached (at which point the thread will terminate).  Use coreclr.  ...  Restore the original stdin, stderr,  Close the write fd of pipes,  Wait for the pipe reader thread to terminate.    As coreclr dups the fd for stdin & stderr, there is still a write fd for the pipe, meaning the read thread will never receive an EOF and the program to hang at the last step.  _Copied from original issue: dotnet/coreclr#16880_

Polling interval for example will be the default of 2 minutes.    ---    Using a named cache and loading it via `var cache = new MemoryCache(""notdefault"");` actually works and uses the custom settings (only if you add the section group/section manually ofc).

27930	area-System.Linq	ParallelEnumerable.GroupJoin/Join output ordering (fixes #1155)	The current implementations of ParallelEnumerable.GroupJoin and Join do not preserve the order of right(inner) elements.    The common implementation, `HashJoinQueryOperatorEnumerator` currently implements a `QueryOperatorEnumerator` with an order key of the same type as the left(outer) query, thus Join operations are unable to take into account the order of the right elements in their output. It also completely ignores the right order key when building a `HashLookup` of the right elements, so order is not preserved for GroupJoins.    The proposed changes attempt to leave the cases where the right query is unordered with a relatively similar performance profile while adding ordering (when appropriate) in the cases where the right query is ordered (fixes #1155).    Join with an unordered left and ordered right results in unordered output and right ordering is completely ignored.  Join with an ordered left and ordered right results in ordered output ordered first by left order key then by right order key. If collisions exist in the ordering of left elements, then the output will likely not be intuitive, as results with the same left element are not guaranteed (and in fact will probably not be) grouped together. (tests **not** added to confirm the ordering of elements with left collisions...)    GroupJoin with an unordered left and ordered right also still produce unordered output. However, the enumerables of right elements are ordered.  GroupJoin with an ordered left and ordered right will produce results ordered first by the left element order key, then by the least right element order key. An empty grouping of right elements is treated as less than any non-empty grouping. (tests added to confirm the ordering of elements with left collisions)

On others (eg some Ubuntu and Debian) dumps are enabled but gdb is not present. We also want lldb so we can do more operations on the dumps.    So we need to add install of gdb and lldb to all dockerfiles, and enable dumps with ulimit on all of them.
27908	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler should process idle disconnect from server promptly	For idle connections, we have a _readAheadTask we use to determine if the server sent an EOF to close the connection (or other unexpected data).  We don't check this until we either pull the connection out of the pool, or timeout the connection.  So often there will be a large delay (10s of seconds) between when we receive the EOF and when we actually close the connection on our side.    RFC 7230 says the following:     ```     To avoid the TCP reset problem, servers typically close a connection     in stages.  First, the server performs a half-close by closing only     the write side of the read/write connection.  The server then     continues to read from the connection until it receives a     corresponding close by the client, or until the server is reasonably     certain that its own TCP stack has received the client's     acknowledgement of the packet(s) containing the server's last     response.  Finally, the server fully closes the connection.  ```    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.6    In the interest of being a well-behaved client and trying to make it easier for servers to adhere to the above behavior, we should close the connection promptly when we receive a disconnect from the server.    (I hit this originally because I was trying to implement the above logic in LoopbackServer for tests, but it cause large delays on a bunch of tests because the client didn't promptly close its connection.)

I get type exceptions or missing method exceptions when trying to call code from System.Net.Http namespace.     It seems to fail in many uses of the System.Net.Http namespace.  Once particular example, I have an IHttpClient interface and an HttpClientWrapper class to wrap HttpClient and allow for unit test. My unit tests don't work.    ### Workaround    The csproj is pointing at the Netstandard2.0 version of the dll, which must have some bug that makes the System.Net stuff look like they are different types.    ```      <Reference Include=""System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions, Version=4.1.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51, processorArchitecture=MSIL"">        <HintPath>..\..\packages\System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.4.4.0\lib\netstandard2.0\System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.dll</HintPath>      </Reference>  ```    Manually edit the project. Change it to point to the portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81.    ```      <Reference Include=""System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions, Version=4.1.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51, processorArchitecture=MSIL"">        <HintPath>..\..\packages\System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.4.4.0\lib\portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81\System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.dll</HintPath>      </Reference>  ```    ### Expectation  I shouldn't have to manually edit my project every time I update System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions in a NuGet package.    I expect referenced dlls to work with .Net461.     ### Issues  1. Why does netstandard2.0 not work? Why does it thinks the types are different? I have no idea what the cause of this is or how long it would take to fix.  2. Why does the NuGet package install choose netstandard2.0 over portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81 when dlls in the netstandard2.0 don't work and dlls int the portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81 do work? My guess is precedence or preference. NuGet is coded to prefer netstandard2.0 dlls over dlls in portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81. Is that precedence correct? Probably.  3. Since System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions dlls in the netstandard2.0 folder of the NuGet package do not work, why does the NuGet package not have a net45, net461, or such folder that will take precedence of netstandard2.0? Adding a folder for Net461 with dlls that work takes a few minutes.     So until the first issue is fixed, can we get an updated NuGet package that properly points net461 projects to working dll?

27898	area-System.Net	Eat exceptions from SocketsHttpHandler's readahead task	When SocketsHttpHandler puts a connection back into the pool, it issues a pre-emptive asynchronous read on the transport stream.  This enables us to check whether any unexpected data has arrived on the connection, whether the connection has been closed, etc., and without polling (which could be done with a NetworkStream but not well with an SslStream).  However, when we dispose of a connection from the pool, this task will potentially end up getting faulted, and while it won't crash the application by default, it will end up invoking the TaskScheduler.UnobservedException event.    This commit address this by ensuring that we always observe any exceptions that come from the read ahead task when the connection is disposed of (in the rare case where an HttpConnection is instead left for finalization, the event may still be raised, which is arguably a good thing, as the developer should be disposing responses.)    (The alternative would be to stop using the read ahead, and instead poll every time we wanted to know if the connection was still valid.  That would mean storing the socket in addition to the stream on the connection, and would mean we might miss some errant data that was already pulled from the socket into an SslStream.  It would also mean at least one more syscall for each request, as we'd check whether a connection from the pool was valid.  For now I'm sticking with the read ahead.)

27896	area-System.ComponentModel	Deprecate BackgroundWorker.RunWorkerAsync	For me, it is very misleading that `BackgroundWorker.RunWorkerAsync` uses the convention with suffix *Async but doesn't return a Task.    Please consider deprecating this method and come with a new methodname.  The same applies to `CancelAsync`    Fixing it would not be possible because it's a breaking change.    Or... deprecate BackgroundWorker completely and come with an (better) alternative.  For example one with async/await, cancellationtoken support etc. Would that be `Task.Factory.StartNew` or `Task.Run`?

27894	area-System.Net	Ensure SendAsync token source is disposed when handler throws	If HttpClient has a non-infinite timeout set, and/or if a cancelable token is passed in, it creates a token source linked to the pending requests token source and the passed in token, and passes that token into base.SendAsync, which in turn just delegates to the wrapped handler's SendAsync.  If that wrapped handler throws an exception synchronously that propagates out of SendAsync, we never end up disposing of the linked token, which will end up leaving a reference to it in both the pending requests token source and the provided token's source.    cc: @davidsh, @geoffkizer 
27893	area-System.Net	Optimize Socket.GetOrAllocateThreadPoolBoundHandle 	This method isn't getting inlined, presumably because there's just enough logic here between this call and the call to SafeCloseSocket.GetOrAllocateThreadPoolBoundHandle (which does get inlined) to prevent inlining.    We should change the logic to simply do a quick check for whether the handle is not null, and then return it; if null, call out to a separate function that does the demand creation.
27892	area-System.Net	Socket async callbacks on Windows process the callback's ExecutionContext twice	We have logic to capture the ExecutionContext and restore it for callbacks in both the IAsyncResult path and the SocketAsyncEventArgs path.  However, on Windows, we are already getting dispatched to the correct ExecutionContext by the Overlapped infrastructure, which on .NET Core always handles the execution context capture and dispatch.    On Unix, the equivalent infrastructure in SocketAsyncContext.Unix.cs does not handle ExecutionContext, so it's only being handled once.    We should add ExecutionContext capture and dispatch to SocketAsyncContext.Unix.cs and then remove it from the higher layers in the Socket stack.    The impact here is small, but every bit helps.

27871	area-System.Net	SocketHttpHandler is failing to parse properly proxy environment variables with special characters.	Consider situation like:    export all_proxy='corefx\foo:SecretPass#1@clrperftst003:3128'    when using curl or curl handler from c# auth to proxy works as expected.     However when I switch to SocketHttpHandler, it fails to parse the string because we use Uri parsing function and that does not like the special characters. With that we fail to instantiate HttpEnvironmentProxy and handler attempts direct connections ignoring proxy setting.   Also note, that we only split user and password. That may possibly create troubles with certain authentication schemes.     Also note, that curl works properly if the string is URL encoded. SocketHTTPHandler also fails in such case.    export all_proxy='corefx%5Cfoo:SecretPass%231@clrperftst003:3128'    
27870	area-System.Net	curl HttpHandler can only do basic auth to proxy	"I have proxy setup with supporting only NTLM authentication and I have simple app fetching given URL through the proxy     ```c#          static async Task fetch2(String uri)          {              HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler();              handler.PreAuthenticate = false;              handler.Proxy = new WebProxy(""clrperftst003:3128"");              handler.Proxy.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(""foo"", ""bar"", ""corefx"");              var client = new HttpClient(handler);              var result1 = await client.GetAsync(uri);              Console.WriteLine(result1);      }  ```    This work when running on Windows but always fails on Ubuntu16.     It seems like the code always sends Basic auth when credentials are available.  When that fails it never tries again with schema supported by the server.   Also note, that the PreAuthenticate has no impact so the client will always leak plaintext password.   I tested this with server supporting Digest or NTLM and behavior is identical.

Fix: Unreadable cookie values must at a minimum be ignored. They should not fail the request. I recall this is the behavior of .NET HttpClient/HttpWebRequest, and CookieCutter already has an option for this.    Workaround, ignore cookies, they're optional for this flow:  ```  .AddTwitter(o =>  {     ...     o.BackchannelHttpHandler = new HttpClientHandler() { UseCookies = false };  })  ```"

Demo code:    ```csharp  var builder = new DbConnectionStringBuilder();  builder.ConnectionString = ""empty=''"";    Console.WriteLine(builder.ContainsKey(""empty""));  // true    Console.WriteLine(builder.ConnectionString);  // prints ""empty=""    // re-parse the conn string  builder.ConnectionString = builder.ConnectionString;    Console.WriteLine(builder.ContainsKey(""empty""));  // false    Console.WriteLine(builder.ConnectionString);  // prints """" (empty string)  ```    Expected outputs when this is fixed would be that the last 2 outputs are the same as the first 2 outputs."

27840	area-System.Text	Add a RegexExpression class and method-based regular expression	"I made this proposal to C# repo.  https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1364  It concerns a LinQ syntax for Regular expressions. Apparently it depends on a RegexExpression Class and some extension methods.   RgxExpression calass should have some construcors to allow create an instance based on a regex string, or another RgxExpression instance or expression. This will help define repeated expression, and maje use ofregex language. RgxExpression.ToString() will return the regex string.  The RgxExpression can be like this:  ```  class RgxExpression   {     public string Expression {get; set;}          }  ```    The extenstion methods should be like this:    ```  RgxExpression Foo (this RgxExpression exp)  {    RgxExpression exp1 = ........;      return Merge(exp.Expression, exp1);  }    ```  This is how I represent email regex for example:  ```  var smalls = Range(""a"", ""z"");  var caps = Range(""A"",""Z"")  var L = Any(smalls, cap, Digit, ""."", ""_"", ""-"")  var W1 = L.Repeat(1);  var W2 = L.Repeat(2, 4);  var email = Boundary.W1.Constant(""@"").W1.Constant(""."").W2.Boundary;  string rgx = email.ToString();    In the discussion it appears that there are some similar work like:  https://github.com/sprache/Sprache  https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/CSharpVerbalExpressions.  The problem is there are 100,000 NuGets and impossible to explore them all!  My question is: why don't you embrace this idea and add a method-based regular expression, to make it easy for programmers to understand and use?  Being a part of the language will make it popular than being an infamous NuGet.   By the way: Fast growing NuGets should have an online magazine or something to let us know about. This is a huge fortune but not easy to dig out its treasures.   "

27838	area-System.Net	Avoid timing issue in IOControl_SIOCATMARK tests	This test is sending out of band data, and then checking that it has been received immediately. Depending on timing the check may actually be hit before the data is received, so we need to give it some time.    When I updated these tests in PR #27583 I didn't consider that sent data wouldn't be received instantaneously. That was taken into consideration in the original tests and mitigated with `SpinWait.SpinUntil`, but after my update that check was in the wrong spot. This fix moves them to the right place.

27811	area-System.IO	Consider adding Scatter/Gather IO on Stream	"The Socket class has this already, in the form of Send/Receive operations that take an `IList<ArraySegment<byte>>`.  This isn't exposed up through Stream classes, however.      One specific scenario where this would be useful is writing chunked-encoded request bodies in SocketsHttpHandler.  When the user calls the request Stream's Write[Async] method, we need to first write a chunk header with the chunk length followed by \r\n, then write the chunk contents from the user's buffer to the underlying stream (which is either SslStream or NetworkStream).  This requires us to either do two writes (which means two kernel calls and means the chunk header will likely be sent in a separate packet), or to copy into a local buffer so we can do a single write.  It would be more performant (and simpler) to do a gather write where we pass two buffers, the first containing the chunk header, the second containing the chunk data, passed directly through.    There are various examples in HTTP2 where scatter/gather IO would be useful as well.  (Mostly gather, since gather helps deal with the ""framing"" scenario above.  Scatter reads are less useful since you don't control the framing yourself.)    Proposed API:    ```csharp          public virtual int Read(IReadOnlyList<Memory<byte>> buffers);          public virtual void Write(IReadOnlyList<ReadOnlyMemory<byte>> buffers);          public virtual ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(IReadOnlyList<Memory<byte>> buffers, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);          public virtual ValueTask WriteAsync(IReadOnlyList<ReadOnlyMemory<byte>> buffers, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);  ```    The base Stream class would provide default implementations on top of existing Read/Write APIs."

I also want a dedicated document explaining a new era and help creating it.    - At present Japanese Calendar is the only Calendar which a new era could be added. https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/v2.0.5/src/mscorlib/shared/System/Globalization/CalendarData.Unix.cs#L269  - For Windows, Japanese era info is obtained from registry. Once registry is updated to the new era, .NET Core on WIndows can get a new era info. https://msdn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/library/windows/desktop/dd317805%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396  - For Unix (Linux and Mac), Japanese era info is obtained from lib-icu. Once a new version of icu is installed to the machine, .NET Core on Unix can get a new era info.  https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/v2.0.5/src/mscorlib/shared/Interop/Unix/System.Globalization.Native/Interop.Calendar.cs  - In the case .NET Core can't get a era info from registry on Windows and lib-icu on Unix, .NET Core uses [a hard-coded era info](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/v2.0.5/src/mscorlib/shared/System/Globalization/JapaneseCalendar.cs#L97-L120). I'm not sure when this hard-coded era info is used actually. However in this case, upgrading .NET Core CLR is required to update a new era info. Also, if the application is built as a Self Contained Application, I wonder we can't update the a new era info in this application.    Are these issues related?  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27506  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27617            
27797	area-Microsoft.CSharp	[WIP] ignore static target type in restrictions	
27796	area-System.Net	Remove faulty assert from SocketAsyncEventArgs	AllocateNativeOverlapped asserts that !_currentSocket.SafeHandle.IsValid.  This should be a fine assert, except that SafeCloseSocket for some reason overrides IsInvalid to actually be IsClosed || IsInvalid.  And so that assert is actually checking whether the SafeHandle is both not invalid and not closed, but disposal could be racing with the operation and the socket could have been closed by the time we get here.    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27784  cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh
27795	area-System.Data	SqlBulkCopy: Add hooks to enable retry strategies on batches	If SqlBulkCopy encounters any kind of exception as it inserts rows into a table, it fails the entire job.     In some scenarios, certain errors might be appropriate to retry - for instance, a deadlock or timeout. While this might be unlikely when doing bulk inserts to a staging table, it is much more likely if the table is also shared by a web application, for instance.    For this reason, until now we've instead used Table Valued Parameters.    It would be helpful though if SqlBulkCopy gave us a mechanism to apply a retry strategy as appropriate.     _If this isn't the appropriate place to post suggestions like this, let me know. If there was interest in the above, I would happily investigate the feasibility of this further._

27792	area-System.Net	Consider some search/spider-based testing for SocketsHttpHandler	We could, for example, write a simple client that did some Bing searches and then made requests to the top 1000 results with multiple handlers and validate various things, at a minimum that requests succeed and fail similarly, maybe something about the content if possible, etc. We could also, for example, write a little spider that walked over some sites and did similar validation.

27789	area-System.Runtime	Add tests to exercise sbyte string constructors with invalid UTF8	Regression test for variant of https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/16786    Depends on https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16749/ that is fixing this bug as side-effect.
27787	area-Infrastructure	Updating the package index for UAP and updating buildtools	This will update the packageIndex to show the correct data of the packages that we shipped on UAP RS3 and it will also take care of the buildtools update that will get the new NuGet mappings.    cc: @weshaggard @ericstj     Given that the uap builds are now working on master, this PR will basically replicate the previous PR I created against release/2.1 but on master. I haven't yet merged the other one, and so if this goes in I will just close the release/2.1 one.

27783	area-System.Net	[Preview2] Make SocketsHttpHandler default Handler	We want to switch default HttpClientHandler to SocketsHttpHandler for 2.1 (starting with Preview2).    We need to keep the escape route to fall back to WinHttp & LibCurl handlers (when explicitly set).  Most relevant code is here:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/HttpClientHandler.cs#L17-L37    Part of the task is also to:  1. Verify all CoreFX tests pass (esp. Data which depends on Http stack) - incl. outer loop CI legs  2. Verify that WCF tests pass (please work with Paulo & WCF team to run all their test suites, ideally prior to checkin)  3. Keep testing WinHttp & LibCurl handlers (e.g. change ManagedHandler Http test suite to PlatformHandler Http test suite)    cc @geoffkizer

27776	area-System.Security	RSA incompatibility between full framework and .net core?	"I have a problem when working with RSA in .NET Full framework (4.6.2) and .net core 2. There is an existing full framework application that encrypts and decrypts files using certificates. The goal is to create a compatible .net core application that can exchange encrypted files with the existing application.     In short, an symmetrical AES key is used to encrypt the actual file data. The AES key is then encrypted with the receivers public RSA key.    I got it working 3/4 of the way. That is:   * The full framework application can (of course) encrypt files and decrypt them.   * The .net core application can encrypt files and decrypt them.  *  The .net core application can encrypt files, which can be decrypted with the full framework application.  *  The .net core application **cannot** decrypt files, which have been encrypted with the full framework application.    In the last case I get an `WindowsCryptographicException` with the message `The parameter is incorrect` (internally its Error code 87).    The full 4.6.2 framework application uses the certificate of the receiver as such:    ```  var rsa = receiverCertificate.PublicKey.Key as RSACryptoServiceProvider;  // *snip* create AES key  var encryptedAesKey = rsa.Encrypt(aesManaged.Key, false);  ```    When decrypting, it does the following:  ```  var rsa = receiverCertificate.PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;  // *snip* extract encrypted aes key from encrypted file  var decryptedKey = rsa.Decrypt(encryptedKey, false);  ```    Now, in .net core it is not possible to cast the key directly to `RSACryptoServiceProvider`.  To re-use most of the existing code and port that over to .NET core I wrote these two extension methods to get an `RSACryptoServiceProvider` out of the keys, like this:    ```  public static RSACryptoServiceProvider GetPublicKeyRsaCryptoServiceProvider(this X509Certificate2 certificate)  {     // Get params from public key     var rsa = certificate.GetRSAPublicKey();     var rsaParameters = rsa.ExportParameters(false);       var csp = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(rsa.KeySize, new CspParameters()     {        ProviderType = 24,        ProviderName = ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"",     });     csp.ImportParameters(rsaParameters);       return rsacsp;  }    public static RSACryptoServiceProvider GetPrivateKeyRsaCryptoServiceProvider(this X509Certificate2 certificate)  {     // Get params from private key     var rsa = certificate.GetRSAPrivateKey();     var rsaParameters = rsa.ExportParameters(true);       var csp = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(rsa.KeySize, new CspParameters()     {        ProviderType = 24,        ProviderName = ""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider"",     });     csp.ImportParameters(rsaParameters);         return rsacsp;  }  ```    The only lines I changed while porting the existing code over to .net core were the lines that casted the public/private key to `RSACryptoServiceProvider `and replaced the casts with calls to my extension methods.  Before changing more and to completely move over to the RSA class from `RSACryptoServiceProvider`, so that the .net core application can eventually run on other OSes, I want this to work first in a full roundtrip.  For additional info: I get hold of the `X509Certificate2` instance like this:    ```  using (var myStore = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser))  {     myStore.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);     var certs = myStore.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByKeyUsage,    X509KeyUsageFlags.DataEncipherment.ToString(), true);     return certs.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Subject.Contains(""receiver""));  }  ```    The error is thrown in the actual call to `RSACryptoServiceProvider.Decrypt()`, when it goes through the `CapiHelper.Decrypt()` into `CapiHelper.Interop.CryptDecrypt()` which returns with the error code.

27775	area-System.Net	Activity for HttpClient calls not stopped if inner handler does not use async/await (PR 2)	"Note: This is a new version of #27472. I restored my branch but the PR didn't pick up the new commits. Sorry for that.    Original description from #27472:    I've been writing some `DiagnosticSource`/`Activity` based instrumentation for HttpClient. [In my unit tests](https://github.com/cwe1ss/opentracing-contrib-dotnet/blob/ba20de4ba57e43cb685083e3c0b2b19022ce067e/test/OpenTracing.Contrib.AspNetCore.Tests/HttpOut/HttpOutInterceptorTest.cs) I've created a HttpMessageHandler and wrapped it with the existing `DiagnosticsHandler` (by using reflection, so in an unsupported way) to test the different scenarios.    However, I noticed that if my handler doesn't use `async/await`, the `DiagnosticsHandler` does NOT raise the Diagnostics-events for `System.Net.Http.Exception` and `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestOut.Stop` because the invocation is outside of the try...catch block.    E.g. if DiagnosticsHandler is using an inner handler that looks like this, it does NOT raise the events:  ```csharp  public class FailingHttpMessageHandler : HttpMessageHandler  {      protected override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)      {          throw new InvalidOperationException(""foo"");      }  }  ```    It only works, if I change the code as follows:  ```csharp  public class FailingHttpMessageHandler : HttpMessageHandler  {      protected override async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)      {          await Task.CompletedTask;          throw new InvalidOperationException(""foo"");      }  }  ```    My direct usage of DiagnosticsHandler is obviously a hack as it is internal and AFAIU in a regular application `DiagnosticsHandler` is an internal feature of `HttpClientHandler` so there shouldn't be any user code after it but nevertheless, I think that it would make sense to move the call from this PR into the try..catch block.    /cc @lmolkova @vancem"

27764	area-Meta	Where is System.Web.Http?	Hi,  I'm trying to convert an ASP.NET project from .NET Framework 4.7.1 to .NET Core 2.1 (preview).  My methodology was to rename the folder from `MyAspProj` to `MyAspProj.Old`, then in the solution I created a new .NET Core ASP.NET project called `MyAspProj`, then copied over all the files from `MyAspProj.Old`. I added a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`, which I hoped would bring through all the necessary types. but alas, everywhere that I have references to objects from the `System.Web.Http` namespace, my code is broken, with no obvious contenders to redirect the references.  For example, `HttpConfiguration`, which is used for Owin configuration.  And, while we're there, the Owin package itself is targeting .NET Framework. Is there a successor that targets .NET Core?

Also, we ensure the ProcessWaitHandle is using the same ProcessWaitState as the Process it was created for.    The above test code no longer throws now when the PID is recycled. I have not added a test because it takes a long time to run.    CC @stephentoub @danmosemsft "

27745	area-System.Net	Add support for SocketsHttpHandler to use provided SPN	WCF has the requirement to use non-default SPN's when using Kerberos authentication over HTTP. The `AuthenticationHandler` class specifies the SPN in [this line of code](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/SocketsHttpHandler/AuthenticationHelper.NtAuth.cs#L52). WCF needs a way to optionally specify which value is used on this line.     Ideally this would be exposed via an api mechanism available on `HttpClientHandler`/`HttpClient`/`HttpRequestMessage` so that WCF wouldn't need to dictate that a client always uses `SocketsHttpHandler` once available. We need to be able to specify either a mapping between hostname and SPN or to be able to specify on a per-request basis. This is especially important as there are likely to be some compatibility edge cases with `SocketsHttpHandler` once released and we would need to allow developers to specify which implementation that WCF will use.    An issue to expose the ability to specify the SPN in a general way to support mutual authentication was previously opened in 2015 in issue #4502. This issue is a more specific ask for this support to be available in `SocketsHttpHandler` and hopefully for it to be exposed in a more generic manner.

I reproduced it with libcurl3 in version 7.58.0 available in Debian testing repo. Temporarily I downgraded myself back to 7.52.1 available in Debian stable and I can't reproduce the issue anymore, at least for now.    The exception itself isn't exactly in my code but in third-party library I'm using, although there is nothing unusual there.    ```csharp          private async Task<RestResponse> SendInternalAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancelToken, bool headerOnly)          {              cancelToken = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(_cancelToken, cancelToken).Token;              HttpResponseMessage response = await _client.SendAsync(request, cancelToken).ConfigureAwait(false);                            var headers = response.Headers.ToDictionary(x => x.Key, x => x.Value.FirstOrDefault(), StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);              var stream = !headerOnly ? await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync().ConfigureAwait(false) : null;                return new RestResponse(response.StatusCode, headers, stream);          }  ```    I'm using one of the recent master builds and I didn't see anything related fixed lately.    ```  .NET Command Line Tools (2.1.300-preview2-008293)    Product Information:   Version:            2.1.300-preview2-008293   Commit SHA-1 hash:  68922e2a51    Runtime Environment:   OS Name:     debian   OS Version:   OS Platform: Linux   RID:         debian-x64   Base Path:   /opt/dotnet/sdk/2.1.300-preview2-008293/    Host (useful for support):    Version: 2.1.0-preview2-26227-01    Commit:  86d1f92013    .NET Core SDKs installed:    2.1.300-preview2-008293 [/opt/dotnet/sdk]    The.NET Core runtimes installed:    Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.0-preview2-30171 [/opt/dotnet/shared]    Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.0-preview2-26227-01 [/opt/dotnet/shared]    Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.0-preview2-30171 [/opt/dotnet/shared]  ```    I'm now making sure that old libcurl version fixes the issue, since I could've identified the root cause wrong, but for now I can't run into this issue anymore with older libcurl version. I'll make sure to let you know in case it's something else, but if my guess was right then this should be fixed in corefx repo, and stacktrace suggests that even if my guess is wrong then there is some incompatibility in net core internals that should be verified.    Also I have no clue under exactly what condition the exception is happening. It's definitely related to HTTP2 connection, but it seems that not all requests going through HTTP2 throw this exception (?)    Thank you in advance for looking into this.
27729	area-System.Memory	Fix Utf8ParserFormatter test culture settings dependency	Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27664    Make sure we're always using the invariant culture  when generating test data using the classic .NET api.
27728	area-System.Net	Fix order of native overlapped freeing in SocketAsyncEventArgs on Windows	SocketAsyncEventArgs tracks its disposal, and if it's disposed while an async operation is in flight, it delays the actual disposal until the operation completes.  That disposal includes disposing of the PreAllocatedOverlapped used for async operations.  When an operation is initiated, if the operation completes synchronously, then the NativeOverlapped associated with that PreAllocatedOverlapped is freed in a finally block once the operation completes synchronously.  But if during the operation the SAEA is disposed of, then the PreAllocatedOverlapped can get disposed of before the finally block.    The fix is to ensure we clean up the NativeOverlapped before completing the operation.  This was already handled correctly when an operation completed asynchronously, it just needed to be fixed for when it completes synchronously.  As a happy side-effect, fixing this also cleans up the call sites a bit.    (This was highlighted by an assert once we switched Socket.WriteAsync to return a ValueTask instead of a Task, because the way it was done means that when the Socket is disposed, the associated SocketAsyncEventArgs will be disposed, and SocketsHttpHandler is aggressive about disposing of the Socket as a way to enable cancellation, so the assert was triggering not-infrequently when running the System.Net.Http tests, especially in CI.)

27727	area-System.Net	Add folded response header support to SocketsHttpHandler	The feature is deprecated by RFC 7230, but some servers still utilize it, and if they do, SocketsHttpHandler currently fails (WinHttpHandler and the netfx handler both allow it, CurlHandler currently fails as well).  This commit updates the header parsing logic to allow for them.    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh
27726	area-System.Text	Use generic WeakReference and avoid casting in Regex	Using WeakReference<T> with a simple lock instead of Interlocked.Exchange for SharedReference.    @stephentoub you commented in another PR that I could use a simple lock for the ExclusiveReference. As concurrent calls shouldn't wait until the lock is released but return immediately, I don't think that's possible here with just lock?

27724	area-System.IO	File.ReadAllTextAsync not behaving asynchronously when called on inaccessible network files	"When accessing a file on a network share that for some reason cannot be accessed (e.g. server not existent), `File.ReadAllTextAsync` appears to block, rather than running asynchronously, until the file request fails. This can be reproduced with the following console app:    ```csharp  using System;  using System.Collections.Generic;  using System.IO;  using System.Linq;  using System.Threading.Tasks;    namespace ReadAllTextAsync  {      class Program      {          public static void Main(string[] args)          {              Console.WriteLine(""Beginning"");                int count = 20;              var files = Enumerable.Range(0, count).Select(i => $@""\\server_{Guid.NewGuid():N}\file.txt"").ToList();              var tasks = new List<Task>();                foreach (string file in files)              {                  tasks.Add(_ReadFile(file));              }                Console.WriteLine(""Waiting..."");                Task.WhenAll(tasks).Wait();                Console.WriteLine(""Ending"");          }            private static async Task _ReadFile(string file)          {              try              {                  // await Task.Delay(1); // Uncomment this line allows calls to execute in parallel                  string text = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(file);              }              catch              {                  Console.WriteLine($""Error reading file: {file}"");              }          }      }  }  ```  The result of running the above code is a regular stream of (the expected) ""Error reading file"" messages but they come in slowly one after the other.    When uncommenting the `await Task.Delay(1)` line, the messages all come in nearly simulataneously. I would have expected this behaviour without this line.    I believe this is to do with the behaviour of the `new FileStream` object in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/release/2.0.0/src/System.IO.FileSystem/src/System/IO/File.cs    ```csharp          private static StreamReader AsyncStreamReader(string path, Encoding encoding)          {              FileStream stream = new FileStream(                  path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read, DefaultBufferSize,                  FileOptions.Asynchronous | FileOptions.SequentialScan);                return new StreamReader(stream, encoding, detectEncodingFromByteOrderMarks: true);          }  ```  which is called before any code is awaited."
27723	area-System.Collections	Move, Reverse, etc. on LinkedList	Similar to #14338 we need the ability to manipulate a `LinkedList<T>`, most notably moving nodes within the collection. Another use case is to `Merge` one `LinkedList` into another one at a certain position (before / after a node). Technically the architecture of a double linked list and its nodes makes those feature quite easy to implement while offering good performance independent from list size.      ## Useful additions    **Swap** nodes in the collection ([SO Thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3473787/swapping-nodes-on-a-single-linked-list))    ````cs  public void Swap(object foo, object blah)  {      // Currently we exploit the fact that the value of nodes can be set     var fooNode = _list.Find(foo);     var blahNode = _list.Find(blah);     fooNode.Value = blah;     blahNode.Value = foo;       // Proposed    _list.Swap(foo, blah);  }  ````  Overloads for `Swap` should accept nodes and objects.    **Move** nodes within the collection    ````cs  public void MoveNode(object foo, object blah)  {      // Currently     var fooNode = _list.Find(foo);     _list.Remove(blah);     _list.AddAfter(fooNode, blah);       // Proposed    _list.MoveAfter(foo, blah);  }  ````  There should be a method `MoveBefore` and `MoveAfter` with overloads for passing two nodes, one node and one object and two objects. An `InternalMove` method could even be used to replace the code for `AddBefore` and `AddAfter`.    **Insert** one linked list into another  ````cs  public void InsertInto(object foo, LinkedList<object> other)  {     var position = _list.Find(foo);      // Currently     foreach(var foo in other)     {        position = _list.AddAfter(position, foo);     }       // Proposed    _list.InsertAfter(position, other);  }  ````    Here the workaround is especially painful. I can not simply `AddAfter` because this would reverse the direction. I also can not `AddBefore(position.Next, foo)` because I would have to check for end of collection. I can either reverse `other` or steadily update the `position` variable. Because [`System.Linq.Reverse()`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Reverse.cs#L59) does not specifically check for `LinkedList` it will copy the other list to a buffer and reverse iterate that, which is a waste of time and memory in itself.    In each case inserting item-by-item also causes constant updates of the pointers that are complety unnessary when looking at the end result. Only the pointers for the first and last node of `other` as well as `position` and possibly `position.Next`.     **ReverseIterate** a linked list    ````cs  public IEnumerable<object> Reverse()  {      // Currently     return _list.Reverse(); // Linq extension copying to buffer       // Proposed new implementation of Reverse     var current = _list.Last;     while(current != null)     {         yield return current;        current = current.Previous;     }  }  ````    I am not sure whether to implement this in `LinkedList` and call it from `Linq.Reverse` or just implementing it in Linq.    ## Conclusion    I know `ArrayList` is the preferred type in .NET for numerous reasons and when just storing data I agree. But right now we have a use-case of a list that is frequently altered, elements are moved or smaller sorted chunks are inserted and removed. The collection as a whole is less important than the information which elements are next to each other. For all this `LinkedList` is the perfect solution by design. Unfortunately the current implementation of [`LinkedList<T>`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Collections/src/System/Collections/Generic/LinkedList.cs) and its [`LinkedListNode<T>`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Collections/src/System/Collections/Generic/LinkedList.cs) is locked down like Fort-Knox, making it impossible to add the features in a derived type, even if I wanted to.  So I need to decide whether to implement the entire list myself or to work around the features. Most of the workarounds (e.g. Remove + AddBefore instead of MoveBefore) require creating new objects instead of changing references because most operations and members are internal or perform node validation when trying to insert nodes from a different collection.

I wasn't sure where to post this but I thought it was worth mentioning as an important feedback, my partners and I are big fans of what .NET Core is able to achieve (and the tools available for it) but we had to look elsewhere due to the fact that we need to be as efficient as possible due to our limited resources.

Also, the static Vector calss can use it to do operations on two arrays in slices. Ecah method in the Vector class can have another overload with two T[] params instead of Vector< T > param and returns T[] or Memory< T >. If Vector< T > can make use of Span<T> slices (by adding a new constuctor that accepts Span< T >), it will be easy and fast to repeat the same operations on the array slices.

27685	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: Add response drain timeout	We have a byte limit for response drain, but not a time limit.  So a poorly behaved server could tie up the connection indefinitely.  We should add a time limit.    EDIT 3/6/2018 by @stephentoub.  Adding API proposal:  ```C#  public int MaxResponseDrainSize { get; set; } // exists  public TimeSpan MaxResponseDrainTime { get; set; } // new (exists in implementation but as internal)  ```
27684	area-System.Data	Consider making DbDataReader implement IAsyncEnumerable	DbDataReader is used to stream rows from a database. Although it does implement IEnumerable (of DbDataRecord), that API is old and rarely-used (it's non-generic, sync-only and quite inefficient).    Consider making DbDataReader implement IAsyncEnumerable, to provide a modern and efficient API for going through the rows. This would simply be a layer implemented on top of DbDataReader's existing async operations (e.g. `ReadAsync()`), so it wouldn't require any sort of change from providers.
27682	area-System.Data	Add ValueTask overloads to ADO.NET async APIs	With https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27445 allowing elimination of allocations in asynchronously-executing async methods, we should look into adding ValueTask-returning counterparts to ADO.NET. This would potentially allow zero-allocation database access.    I'm not sure what naming should be like. Some parts of corefx are lucky in that they're introducing ValueTask overloads along with Span (e.g. Stream) but ADO.NET has no upcoming parameter changes/additions.    Here are the relevant methods:    ```c#  ValueTask DbConnection.OpenAsync(...);    ValueTask<DbDataReader> DbCommand.ExecuteReaderAsync(...);  ValueTask<DbDataReader> DbCommand.ExecuteDbDataReaderAsync(...);  ValueTask<object> DbCommand.ExecuteScalarAsync(...);  ValueTask DbCommand.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(...);    ValueTask<bool> DbDataReader.ReadAsync(...);  ValueTask<T> DblDataReader.GetFieldValueAsync<T>(...);  ValueTask<bool> DbDataReader.IsDBNullAsync(...);  ```    Note that there are some missing async methods in ADO.NET in general (e.g. `DbCommand.Prepare()`, `DbConnection.BeginTransactionAsync(...)`, `DbTransaction.CommitAsync(...)`...). These can be added directly with return value ValueTask.

27660	area-System.Diagnostics	EventSource: Arrays in the Event payload are not supported	"I see a major problem with the Lttng output on Linux when an array is passed to an Event using a custom EventSource.    One of the events in our EventSource includes a byte array in its payload. [a data buffer]  On Windows the event log correctly shows the data in that buffer, but on Linux it simply shows ""System.Byte[]"".  Apparently it is using ToString() which will not work for arrays.    I am simply passing a Byte[] to the WriteEvent() function in my EventSource:    ```          [Event(6, Level = EventLevel.LogAlways)]          private void DataMsg(String action, String msgType, UInt32 sesssion, UInt32 request, Int32 length, Byte[] data)          {              WriteEvent(6, action, msgType, sesssion, request, length, data);          }  ```    I copied the log file [chanel0_0] to Windows and read it using Notepad++.  (I'm sure there is a simple way to read it on Ubuntu but I'm not familiar with Linux.)    An example of the payload received from this DataMsg event follows:  **{""action"":""SEND"", ""msgType"":""Start"", ""sesssion"":9774, ""request"":1, ""length"":61, ""data"":System.Byte[]}**    Everything looks good except for the 'data' value.  On Windows the *.etl file contains the actual contents of the data buffer.  (This value is displayed in PerfView as a hex-string.) "

27643	area-System.Net	Consider Socket.OSSupportsUnixDomainSockets property	`System.Net.Socket` currently has these two properties:  ```C#  public static bool OSSupportsIPv4 { get; }  public static bool OSSupportsIPv6 { get; }  ```  In .NET Core 2.1, we've added a public EndPoint-derived type for Unix domain sockets (UnixDomainSocketEndPoint).  Unix domain sockets work across all Unixes we target, but Windows is also adding support (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/12/19/af_unix-comes-to-windows/), and we can support that via UnixDomainSocketEndPoint as well.  We should consider adding:  ```C#  public static bool OSSupportsUnixDomainSockets { get; }  ```
27642	area-Infrastructure	ApiCompat giving incorrect error about implementation instead of correctly pointing to the contract	The ApiCompat error from https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27640#issuecomment-369808688 seems to be reversed.    ```text  D:\GitHub\Fork\corefx\src\shims\ApiCompat.proj(76,5): error : TypeCannotChangeClassification : Type 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ConfiguredValueTaskAwaitable.ConfiguredValueTaskAwaiter' is marked as readonly in the contract so it mu  st also be marked readonly in the implementation.  ```    The fix was to add `readonly` to the ref (contract). The error message indicates that the contract is marked as readonly, but the implementation is not, which is the opposite of what it should have been.    Any ideas why?  cc @ericstj, @weshaggard, @joperezr, @stephentoub   
27639	area-Infrastructure	Improve ref assembly generation process	Currently reference assembly sources are checked into the repository and generated manually. Nothing in the build system validates that the resulting reference assemblies actually match the implementation assemblies.    This is very error prone process. Especially for external contributor who doesn't know that they need to run some custom build target to regenerate the ref assembly sources. As it happened a few times already for System.Reflection.Metadata these ref assemblies get out of sync.     The unit tests do not catch these breaks since they need to reference the implementation assembly in order to access internal methods and types for testing purposes. These breaks go thus unnoticed.
27638	area-System.Net	TcpClient uses Socket class which can fail in odd ways on UWP	I am unsure what the actual cause of this is, but when I call Connect on a TcpClient that is working on an endpoint that is connected to the machine via VPN, then the underlying Socket connect call returns AccessDenied (as stated [here](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d9171ccf-efbc-498a-bc4d-ebe58055d3a7/uwpcannot-connect-to-private-server-socketerror-accessdenied?forum=wpdevelop)).  The link suggests using StreamSocket to connect, but how can I do that when this is an implementation detail of TcpClient.  Is there no way to accomplish this connection?

Test case:  ```          [TestMethod]          public void TestStringBuilderInsert()          {              const int iterationGranularity = 10000;              var buffer = new StringBuilder();              var s = new string(' ', 10);              Console.WriteLine($""{buffer.Length}->{buffer.Capacity}"");              var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();              for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++)              {                  for (int i = 1; i <= iterationGranularity; i++)                  {                      buffer.Clear();                      buffer.Append(s);                      buffer.Append(s);                      buffer.Append(s);                      buffer.Insert(0, s);                      buffer.Insert(0, s);                  }                  Console.WriteLine($""{sw.ElapsedMilliseconds,5}: {buffer.Length}->{buffer.Capacity}"");              }              sw.Stop();          }  ```  Test result:  ```  0->16     71: 50->100042    251: 50->200042    548: 50->300042   1456: 50->400042   2807: 50->500042   4311: 50->600042   6091: 50->700042   8007: 50->800042   9999: 50->900042  12203: 50->1000042  ```  So, the question: If I never put into builder more than 50 characters at the iteration why the Capacity is over 1e6?   Moreover if you use memory profiler, you will understand that the memory usage is much worse that it seems at first glance.  Screenshot of profiler I will attach.

A small method that has no locals but contains localloc instruction and has InitLocals set to true should not be encoded with tiny header since tiny header implies InitLocals is false.

27607	area-System.Security	RSACryptoServiceProvider/RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter fail for SHA256	I can consistently reproduce a problem when verifying a signature with the SHA256 algorithm.    I initially got an issue when trying to validate JWTs (RS256) with JwtSecurityTokenHandler's ValidateSignature. However, drilling thru the source code, I found that the problem occurs when RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter validates the signature with the SHA256 algorithm.    The thing is, the tokens are valid. I can validate them all in JavaScript and on jwt.io (RS256).    Also, the token signature validation always succeeds when I validate tokens from Google and always fail when validating token from ForgeRock (https://www.forgerock.com/). But again, all the tokens from ForgeRock validate properly in JavaScript and on jwt.io, so there's really something happening in .NET.     I join a small console app that validates token signatures from Google and from ForgeRock. Although they are now expired, both of these tokens passed validation in JavaScript and on jwt.io and their signature validation with SHA256 should work in both cases, not just with Google's token.    Thanks in advance for any follow up, this is a critical issue for us.    (We've already been thru Stackoverflow and other forums.)

27606	area-System.Reflection	Unhelpful error when Activator.CreateInstance can't find default constructor	When `Activator.CreateInstance` tries to create an object without a default constructor, it fails with the unhelpful error `System.MissingMethodException: No parameterless constructor defined for this object.`    It would be much more helpful if this error message contained the actual type that was failing to be constructed - e.g. `System.MissingMethodException: No parameterless constructor defined for Namespace.NoParamaterlessConstructor`    This is particularly useful when the code is trying to load types from some kind of configuration file, in which a stack trace alone may not allow you to identify what type it was trying to instantiate.    Repo code:  ```csharp      class Program      {          static void Main(string[] args)          {              var x = Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(NoParameterlessConstructor));          }      }        class NoParameterlessConstructor      {          public NoParameterlessConstructor(object foo) { }      }  ```

The application runs on Windows and we are migrating it to dotnet core in order to work Linux.    I have 2 problems on **Linux** environment:  1- TransactionScope is not supported  2- The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool.  This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in use and max pool size was reached.    We tried to use dotnet core 2.0 and system.Data.SqlClient Version 4.5.0-preview1-26216-02. The Connection pool problem is solved but the TransactionScope problem is not solved. (MSDTC problems, this platform does not support Distributed Transaction)    We tried to use dotnet core 2.1 and System.Data.SqlClient Version 4.5.0-preview2-26228-08. The TransactionScope is solved but the connection pool problem is not solved.    Thank you for your support.
27604	area-System.Net	HttpClientHandler: Consider exposing ConnectTimeout 	Exposing the ConnectTimeout on HttpClientHandler like suggested on SocketsHttpHandler (#27235) and WinHttpHandler (#27603). It will also make it possible to be consistent with the CurlHandler without making the CurlHandler public.    ```  public sealed class HttpClientHandler {      public TimeSpan ConnectTimeout { get; set; } // defaults to infinite so that it's opt-in / pay for play      ...  }  ```
27603	area-System.Net	WinHttpHandler: Consider exposing ConnectTimeout 	In some environments, in particular in a cloud, it's useful to be able to specify a timeout for just the connection phase of an HTTP request. That way, if the server is unresponsive, we don't need to wait for the full HttpClient timeout to cancel the request, and conversely, setting a small HttpClient timeout to avoid such issues doesn't cancel an active operation taking a long time simply because it's conversing a lot.    We should add:  ```  public sealed class WinHttpHandler {      public TimeSpan ConnectTimeout { get; set; } // defaults to infinite so that it's opt-in / pay for play      ...  }  ```  The underlying Interop.WinHttp.WinHttpSetTimeouts has the connect timeout, which is currently not set.

27597	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: Should only do preauthentication when credentials are a CredentialCache	Currently, when PreAuthenticate is set to true, we always send basic credentials on every request to every server.    To avoid sending credentials to servers that don't care, we should only preauthenticate when the credentials are a CredentialCache and thus known to be specific to a particular server.    I tried making this change in my ntlm PR (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27551), but it caused failures on Linux/OSX only -- Windows worked fine.  No idea why the behavior differs by platform (it's all SocketsHttpHandler so should be consistent).  The failures were in PostNonRewindableContentUsingAuth_PreAuthenticate_Success; see here for more details: https://mc.dot.net/#/user/geoffkizer/pr~2Fjenkins~2Fdotnet~2Fcorefx~2Fmaster~2F/test~2Ffunctional~2Fcli~2F/abfadff769bb9dbba1dc870f70944d1fbb26ad87/workItem/System.Net.Http.Functional.Tests    We should understand why the behavior is different by platform.  We should also consider adding pre-auth tests specifically; I don't think we have any tests that explicitly validate preauth behavior (as opposed to just confirming that auth succeeded, whether preauth actually occurred or not).    cc @Tratcher, who pointed out this issue originally.

Many of the references in the solution explorer appear with an exclamation mark.  The project seems to build successfully, but the warnings cause concern that something is wrong.    These build warnings don't seem like they should be expected or desirable.  Is there something obvious I'm doing wrong or misunderstanding?    I do not get these build warnings if I follow all the above steps but instead target .NET 4.6.1.    You may ask why I'd want to reference System.* nuget packages when I'm targeting .NET 4.7.1.  Instead I should use the 'in box' System.* references from the .net framework.  My real problem is in trying to reference the nuget package ['IdentityModel' v3.3.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityModel/).  This brings in a dependency on the System.Net.Http nuget package (not the built in framework reference) and thus, I get these warnings.  My repro is just the basic scenario of directly referencing the System.Net.Http nuget package, but in my case I want to use IdentityModel and don't have any choice or control over the dependencies.    IdentityModel is part of the popular ""Identity Server"" OSS product, so I would expect my scenario to be very natural/mainstream.    "

27589	area-System.Reflection	Add API that allows the emitter to indicate presence of localloc	When encoding method body header the encoder needs to decide whether to emit tiny or fat header. A small method that has no locals but contains `localloc` instruction and has InitLocals set to true should not be encoded with tiny header since tiny header implies InitLocals is false. The presence of `localloc` instruction needs to be indicated by the caller of the method body encoder similarly to max stack and other info. Hence we need to add an overload that takes an extra bool parameter.    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26910  Implements https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27611
27588	area-System.IO	Investigate failling test in CLI insertion	https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/8689 insertion cause a test `GivenAnInstalledPackageUninstallRollsbackWhenTransactionAborts` fails constantly in REHL 7 Jenkins machine. However, when the test is renamed, the problem is gone. There is no local repo. Also after change test directory, a [similar error](https://ci.dot.net/job/dotnet_cli/job/master/job/release_windows_nt_x64_prtest/2384/testReport/(root)/(empty)/Microsoft_DotNet_ToolPackage_Tests_ToolPackageInstallerTests_GivenAnInstalledPackageUninstallRemovesThePackageWhenTransactionCommits_testMockBehaviorIsInSync__True_/) happened at a different part of the code. This time it is on Windows. But there is still no local repo.    Both tests has Directory Enumerator involved. Consider there is change in that area. I believe we need to find the root cause of the issue.  
27587	area-System.Data	Removal of locks from SNITcpHandle.cs breaks EF tests	Removal of locks in the PR https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27187 breaks EF tests with the following stack trace. To trace this failure to the lock removal I undid the changes in the PR and then just removed the locks without any allocation optimizations.  I could repro this by running EF tests on Windows with Managed SNI and on Linux as well  This could potentially be a timing issue and could repro on Linux in different scenarios.      ```  [xUnit.net 00:01:45.7938557]     Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.QueryBugsTest.Repro5456_multiple_include_group_join_is_per_query_context_async [FAIL]  [xUnit.net 00:01:45.7967113]       System.InvalidOperationException : Invalid attempt to call ReadAsync when reader is closed.

27560	area-System.IO	Add PipeWriter.WaitToWriteAsync api to pipelines	With the current pattern of using pipe there is no way to delay starting producer until consumer starts reading without using the side channel.    If we take HTTP MessageBody as an example we have to start consuming raw bytes and populating message body pipe as soon as the user accesses HttpRequest.MessageBody property instead of waiting for the actual read. This some resource and could be avoided.    I propose adding a method `PipeWriter.WaitToWriteAsync()` that would return `ValueTask` that gets completed when `ReadAsync` is called by the reader and there is no backpressure being applied currently.      ```C#  public abstract class PipeWriter  {      public abstract ValueTask WaitToWriteAsync();  }    ```      Open questions:   - Do we need cancellation token argument.  - Do we need `CancelPendingWaitToWrite`?  - How wuld `CancelPendingFlush` affect this call?  - Do we need result struct with `IsCompleted`?    /cc @davidfowl @KrzysztofCwalina

27554	area-System.Runtime	TypeForwardedFromAttribute accepts null as assemblyFullName	According to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.typeforwardedfromattribute.-ctor?view=netcore-2.0#Definition  there should be a null-check - https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/103639b6ff5aa6ab6097f70732530e411817f09b/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/Runtime/CompilerServices/TypeForwardedFromAttribute.cs#L12. We have a test in mono that checks this behavior so `TypeForwardedFromAttribute `from corefx broke it 🙂

27551	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: add ntlm auth and proxy auth for tunnel, and rework auth handling generally	Several auth-related changes:    (1) Add support for Negotiate and NTLM auth  (2) Add support for proxy auth on SSL proxy tunnel  (3) Consolidate and rework some auth logic  (4) Fix some auth bugs    Note that we don't have automated NTLM tests currently (due to test environment issues), so I tested NTLM auth manually on my local machine against a local IIS server.    Fixes #27477  Fixes #27293  Fixes #26325  Fixes #23154   Fixes #23153     @stephentoub @davidsh @dotnet/ncl 
27550	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: including NT auth sources causes trace test to fail	After adding the NT auth source files to the project, there seems to be some sort of event source conflict.

27549	area-System.Net	[Desktop] System.AccessViolationException on HttpClient with Certificates	"Hi,  I think, this bug relates to #17127, respective to  #15839.  When I'm using mutual authentification per SSL and I send something to a server, then I get a `System.AccessViolationException` without any stack trace.    Here is my custom class which extends `HttpClient` and uses a client certificate and has a custom certificate validation:  ```C#  public class QlcHttpsClient : HttpClient  {   private static readonly QlcHttpsClient instance = new QlcHttpsClient();   public QlcHttpsClient() : base(GetHttpMessageHandler())   {   }     public static QlcHttpsClient Instance   {    get { return instance; }   }     private static HttpMessageHandler GetHttpMessageHandler()   {    X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2();    cert.Import(GetClientCertificate(), ""mypass"", X509KeyStorageFlags.DefaultKeySet);    var clientHandler = new WebRequestHandler();    clientHandler.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);    clientHandler.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = RemoteCertificateValidationCallback;      return clientHandler;   }   private static byte[] GetClientCertificate()   {    var res = new ResourceManager(""QLCClient.resources"", typeof(QlcTestResultsController).Assembly);    byte[] rawCert = (byte[]) res.GetObject(""my_cert"");    return rawCert;   }     private static bool RemoteCertificateValidationCallback(object sender, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)   {    string thumbprint = certificate.GetCertHashString();    string expectedThumbprint = ""5D772BB5C085AB490E2773DAA54EC27F3605BDF9"";    if (certificate.Issuer.Contains(""CN=MyCN"") && thumbprint.Equals(expectedThumbprint, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))    {     return true;    }    return false;   }  }  ```    When I step with Visual Studio line by line, then I get the named Exception on `SendAsync()`.    ```C#  class QlcHttpTransmitter  {   private static readonly QlcHttpsClient client = QlcHttpsClient.Instance;     public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Send(string pathValue, HttpContent content, HttpMethod httpMethod)   {    UriBuilder builder = QlcUriBuilder.GetUriBuilder(pathValue);    HttpRequestMessage httpRequestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(httpMethod, builder.Uri)    {     Content = content    };    HttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(httpRequestMessage); // Throws System.AccessViolationException      return response;   }  }  ```    I'm using .Net Framework 4.6.2 and I get this Exception only in my system test. But when I migrate to .Net Framework 4.7.1 then I get this also in production code. So I think the bug is always there and it depends on the runtime behaviour."

27520	area-System.Net	HttpClient does not handle cookies with a non-matching path	"_From @dgweldon on February 15, 2018 22:28_  I have an interesting problem related to OpenID Connect Authentication in ASP .NET Core.  We have an Identity Server 3 OIDC implementation that uses a client certificate authentication provider.  When migrating to ASP .NET Core, we had no problem integrating with our existing OIDC server.  At least when launched from a browser (Edge, Chrome).    However, we have a small ClickOnce application (using the full .NET framework) that also authenticates and makes calls through the ASP.  It does this by using a HttpClient with a certificate selected by the user.  This ClickOnce application fails during authentication.  The code is pretty simple.    ```  using (WebRequestHandler certHandler = new WebRequestHandler  {     CookieContainer = new CookieContainer(),     ClientCertificateOptions = ClientCertificateOption.Manual,     UseDefaultCredentials = true,     AllowAutoRedirect = true  })  {     // Init     certHandler.ClientCertificates.Add(certificate);       using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient(certHandler) { BaseAddress = baseUri })     {        HttpResponseMessage response = a_client.GetAsync(ssoLoginUri).GetAwaiter().GetResult();        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();          // Process self submitting form responses as long as needed        do        {           response = ProcessFormAutoSubmit(a_client, response);        }        while (response != null);     }  }  ```    After moving to ASP .NET Core, this code no longer works.  The issue is that when MVC redirects to Identity Server, it includes 2 cookies (.ASPNetCore.Correlation.OpenIdConnect and .AspNetCore.OpenIdConnect.Nonce).  Those cookies never make it into my CookieContainer (other cookies from Identity Server are handled fine).  When the signin-oidc callback is made, MVC fails with the error: ""Correlation failed: .AspNetCore.Correlation.OpenIdConnect.9N18bzJ1hcpG5YjRMw_QgUJ_PnapfVx2lBmdvb8Q_zA' cookie not found."".  Makes sense.  But why is the cookie not added?    After playing around, I was able to get around this by handling each redirect and manually adding any cookies that had a path (both of which the 2 missing cookies had).  The code now looks like this:    ```  ...  HttpResponseMessage response = a_client.GetAsync(ssoLoginUri).GetAwaiter().GetResult();  Regex cookiePathRegex = new Regex(@""path=([^;]*);?"");    do  {     // Ideally we would just use automatic redirects in the HttpClient, but we need to intercept cookies for special processing     if (response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Redirect)     {        Uri requestUri = response.Headers.Location;        if (!requestUri.IsAbsoluteUri)        {           requestUri = UriUtil.Combine(response.RequestMessage.RequestUri.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority), response.Headers.Location.OriginalString);        }          response = a_client.GetAsync(requestUri).GetAwaiter().GetResult();          IEnumerable<string> responseCookies = null;        if (response.Headers.TryGetValues(""set-cookie"", out responseCookies))        {           // Cookies that have a path aren't currently supported with HttpClient           // Such cookies are used with the new ASP .NET Core OpenId Connect implementation           // Just manually add these cookies           foreach (string sCookie in responseCookies)           {              Match pathMatch = cookiePathRegex.Match(sCookie);              if (pathMatch.Success)              {                 a_webRequestHandler.CookieContainer.SetCookies(                    UriUtil.Combine(requestUri.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority), pathMatch.Groups[1].Value),                    cookiePathRegex.Replace(sCookie, String.Empty));              }           }        }     }     else     {        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();        response = ProcessFormAutoSubmit(a_client, response);     }  }  while (response != null);  ```      This works, but seems like a hack.  Any idea why these cookies aren't handled by HttpClient?    I realize this may not be directly be an ASP .NET Core issue, but wanted to start here since it seems to be related to cookies from ASP .NET Core.

27511	area-System.Security	Use user-scope chains when doing Find with validOnly=true	".NET Framework's version passes new IntPtr(CAPI.HCCE_CURRENT_USER), so  we need to also pass that same value (eventually) which we control by setting  useMachineContext to false (which is the default for `new X509Chain()`).    Fixes #27405.    No test is added with this because adding trust to CU\Root gives a blocking modal dialog (""are you sure?"").  Turns out, removing something from CU\Root also gives one.    This was verified, however, by splicing a test into the CertificateRequest chains tests:    * Verify that Find(validOnly=false) matched 1 thing  * Verify that FInd(validOnly=true) matched 0 things  * Add the new root to CU\Root (and accept the consent popup)  * Add the new intermediate to CU\CA  * Verify that FInd(validOnly=true) matched 1 thing  * Remove the new intermediate from CU\CA  * Remove the new root from CU\Root (and accept the consent popup)    Given that that test runs 3 times per run (RSA, ECDSA, Hybrid) and I didn't think about the intermediate on the first attempt, many consent dialogs were seen in the making of this fix."

27500	area-System.IO	[API Change] Drop `IMemoryList` and replace with abstract `ReadOnlySequenceSegment`	"Alternative to ""Remove RunningIndex add a way for IMemoryList to provide seek implementation"" https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27435    The is a performance issue with `ReadOnlySequence` as accessing the properties of its segments have to go via interface dispatch which makes them slower an non-inlineable.    Proposed api:  ```csharp  public abstract class ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T>  {      public ReadOnlyMemory<T> Memory { get; protected set; }      public ReadOnlySequenceSegment<T> Next { get; protected set; }      public long RunningIndex { get; protected set; }  }  ```  Changing to an `abstract` class with `protected` setters and non-virtual properties makes them inlinable and fast. The `ReadOnlySequence` doesn't care what the segments are, only that thy have these properties and then it can perform all of its functions:    Removing  ```csharp  public interface IMemoryList<T>  {      public Memory<T> Memory { get; set; }      public IMemoryList<T> Next { get; set; }      public long RunningIndex { get; set; }  }  ```    More functionality can't be delegated via the interface as in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27435 as that will cause greater performance issues for mixed segment type `ReadOnlySequence`s as every call will have to go via the interface for the next block as its real type is unknown.    With the above approach it doesn't need to know what the next block is; it can use the fast base properties.    The total change in Pipelines to work with this faster approach is: (and PR for the change https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27499/commits/63ddad596763675165015c496e9647ee449adec1 )  ```diff  - internal partial sealed class BufferSegment : IMemoryList<byte>  + internal partial sealed class BufferSegment : ReadOnlySequenceSegment<byte>    {  +     private BufferSegment _next;      -     public BufferSegment NextSegment { get; set; }  +     public BufferSegment NextSegment  +     {  +         get => _next;  +         set  +         {  +             _next = value;  +             Next = value;  +         }  +     }  -     public long RunningIndex { get; private set; }  -     public Memory<byte> Memory { get; private set; }  -     public IMemoryList<byte> Next => NextSegment;    }  ```    /cc @davidfowl @KrzysztofCwalina @pakrym @ahsonkhan @stephentoub "

27486	area-System.Runtime	System.Runtime.Intrinsics in .NET Core 2.1	# System.Runtime.Intrinsics in .NET Core 2.1    .NET Core 2.1 has been adding platform intrinsic APIs to support directly calling processor specific instructions, such as Intel’s x86 SIMD instructions.  See the [initial platform intrinsics design](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/master/accepted/platform-intrinsics.md) for more information.    We have decided that it makes the most sense for this intrinsics feature to ship in a “preview” status in the .NET Core 2.1 RTM timeframe.  This means that the runtime support we are implementing will be included, but the assembly exposing the intrinsics will only be available to projects via explicit reference to a “preview-only” package.  These APIs won’t be included in the official .NET Core 2.1 packages.    Given our limited time and resources, recent changes in the approach we take to expose the intrinsics, and API changes prompted by design feedback from the community, we don’t believe there is enough time to settle these APIs for 2.1. We plan to follow the pattern of other recent features like `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` that first shipped in preview before formally joining the supported API surface.  Not only would we expect the next version of .NET Core to support more intrinsics than could be supported in 2.1, but we expect to have real usage examples in CoreFX and higher level components as well.  These real world examples, as well as feedback from customers who opt in to the preview, should give us the confidence we need to officially support the APIs going forward.    ## Details  In the coming days, we plan on removing System.Runtime.Intrinsics.dll from the Microsoft.NETCore.App package.  This means any libraries/applications that are using these APIs will no longer compile by default, and will not run on new builds of .NET Core 2.1.    At the same time, we will start producing a new System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental NuGet package.  In order to continue using these APIs on .NET Core 2.1, a project will need to add a reference to this new package.    As its name implies, this package is experimental and should only be used for preview purposes.  It isn’t expected to be used in production scenarios.  Future version of .NET Core (after 2.1) will be allowed to break this package. This enables us respond to future feedback that requires the APIs to be modified.    In the future, when we are confident we have the intrinsic APIs right, we will stop producing the System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Experimental package. The platform intrinsics APIs will then be added back to Microsoft.NETCore.App and will be officially supported.    ## Call to action    Please review this plan and provide any feedback in the comments of this issue.

27476	area-System.Net	Add MaxResponseDrainSize, and fix a few draining bugs	I've added MaxResponseDrainSize to make the setting configurable rather than a const; I left it internal until the API is approved.    In adding tests for it, I found a few existing bugs in draining that I fixed:  - HttpConnectionResponseContent nulls out its Stream when the Stream is consumed.  Then when the response content is disposed, the Stream is null, so it's not disposed, so it's not drained.  - HttpContentReadStream's Dispose wasn't checking whether it was already called, and would kick off a new draining operation if the connection was still associated.  So if the stream was disposed multiple times, which happens if the response content and stream are both disposed (since the content disposes of the stream), we end up corrupting the response due to multiple threads concurrently accessing and draining it.    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @wfurt  Contributes to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27329

27472	area-System.Net	Activity for HttpClient calls not stopped if inner handler does not use async/await	"I've been writing some `DiagnosticSource`/`Activity` based instrumentation for HttpClient. [In my unit tests](https://github.com/cwe1ss/opentracing-contrib-dotnet/blob/ba20de4ba57e43cb685083e3c0b2b19022ce067e/test/OpenTracing.Contrib.AspNetCore.Tests/HttpOut/HttpOutInterceptorTest.cs) I've created a HttpMessageHandler and wrapped it with the existing `DiagnosticsHandler` (by using reflection, so in an unsupported way) to test the different scenarios.    However, I noticed that if my handler doesn't use `async/await`, the `DiagnosticsHandler` does NOT raise the Diagnostics-events for `System.Net.Http.Exception` and `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestOut.Stop` because the invocation is outside of the try...catch block.    E.g. if DiagnosticsHandler is using an inner handler that looks like this, it does NOT raise the events:  ```csharp  public class FailingHttpMessageHandler : HttpMessageHandler  {      protected override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)      {          throw new InvalidOperationException(""foo"");      }  }  ```    It only works, if I change the code as follows:  ```csharp  public class FailingHttpMessageHandler : HttpMessageHandler  {      protected override async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)      {          await Task.CompletedTask;          throw new InvalidOperationException(""foo"");      }  }  ```    My direct usage of DiagnosticsHandler is obviously a hack as it is internal and AFAIU in a regular application `DiagnosticsHandler` is an internal feature of `HttpClientHandler` so there shouldn't be any user code after it but nevertheless, I think that it would make sense to move the call from this PR into the try..catch block.    /cc @lmolkova @vancem"
27471	area-System.Runtime	AsyncTaskMethodBuilder<decimal> incorrectly caches decimal tasks with zero value	"`AsyncTaskMethodBuilder<decimal>` uses cached tasks for common zero values. There's a check for `(decimal)result == 0m`. The decimal type can store trailing zeroes, though. But `==` is blind to this: `0m == 0.0m`. (I also found no other way to get this comparison to return false. This is in my view an API omission.)    This makes caching observable and creates a wrong result:            static void Main()          {              Console.WriteLine(Return(0m) + "" / "" + Return(0.0m)); // 0 / 0.0              Console.WriteLine(ReturnAsync(0m).Result + "" / "" + ReturnAsync(0.0m).Result); // 0 / 0          }            static decimal Return(decimal value) => value;          static async Task<decimal> ReturnAsync(decimal value) => value;    Both lines should return the same string. The async line is wrong.    I tested this on .NET 4.7.1 but it should apply to all .NET versions where this particular optimization landed."
27469	area-System.Reflection	Requesting a net35 target for the S.R.Metadata package	Projects like https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console (including the engine shared by the console and adapter) and https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover allow users to execute their assemblies on desktop CLR v2 and therefore cannot target net40 or greater.    Without a net35 target, or maintaining such a port, we can't move away from Mono.Cecil. Mono.Cecil has a major drawback for projects that use rely on it, crashing when reading portable PDB information. It hasn't been updated in a while. S.R.Metadata is also better-designed for efficient low-level reading.    This would make it desirable to publish a net35 build of S.C.Immutable. @sharwell has one at https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/dotnet-collections, though adding a net35 target to the S.C.Immutable package would also be welcome for even more projects than stated above.    It looks like this would make the difference for me between days and months of work, so I'm happy to contribute here!
27468	area-System.Net	Memory leak in SendAsync in HttpClient	In corefx/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/HttpClient.cs:SendAsync there seems to be a memory leak that is triggered when CancellationToken.None is used.    We have created HttpClient once and reuse it:        var httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();      httpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) => true;      httpClient = new HttpClient(httpClientHandler);      httpClient.Timeout = Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan;    And are calling like this:        using (var content = PrepareHttpContentJson(input))      using (HttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, new Uri(fullUrl, UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute)))      {        request.Content = content;        using (HttpResponseMessage result = await httpClient.SendAsync(request, CancellationToken.None))        {          // work on result        }      }    PrepareHttpContentJson returns a ByteArrayContent (json content) with ContentType set.    If this code is called repeatably, it leaks every `ByteArrayContent` created.    Looking to the memory using Diagnostic Tools in Visual Studio, this is what seems to lock the memory:        ByteArrayContent         > Action<Stream>          > HttpWebRequest            > ConnectStream            > ContextAwareResult            > HttpClientHandler+RequestState            > CancellationCallbackInfo    If I replace `CancellationToken.None` with `cts.Token` in `SendAsync` and create `var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();` just before the first `using`, the memory leak stops.    I made this attempt as I checked the source code for HttpClient.cs and noticed some handling of cancellation tokens going on and figured this might be the cause.    Note: This MAY be an interaction issue with Autofac, but I don't think so. The `using` code block is resolve by Autofac, but there is only ever 1 instance (registered as single instance) of it (so it wont be disposed between usages).

We can now avoid boxing value type arguments passed in.  3. And because of (2) and value tuples, we can easily pass any number of arguments in without allocating a separate object to store them all.    We should fix this before we ship 2.1.    cc: @benaadams, @davidfowl, @kouvel

Even though we don't have a span version of `Regex.IsMatch()`, exposing the API now will allow easier lighting up of higher performance, lower allocation implementations in the future. (As opposed to customers using `IsMatch` directly and needing to update their clients if we provide a span version in the future.)    ## Details    - We'll pick sensible RegexOptions as a default (as described in the signature comments)  - Users can override either by using Regex directly or using `?(imnsx)` options in their expressions
27453	area-System.Runtime	API Proposal: Add a Generic version of GetValues to Enum (probably GetName/GetNames)	I suggest to implement Generic version of GetValues method in the Enum class.    In present, if we going to get an typed array of some enum values we have to write following code:  `SomeEnum[] values = (SomeEnum[])Enum.GetValues(typeof(SomeEnum));`    It seems as unconvenient way.  In my opinion, the following Generics-based syntax should seems shorter, more convenient and safely (by reason of type casting necessity):  `SomeEnum[] values = Enum.GetValues<SomeEnum>();`    The possible way to implement this syntax is:  ```  public static TEnum[] GetValues<TEnum>() where TEnum : struct  {      Type enumType = typeof(TEnum);      return (TEnum[])enumType.GetEnumValues();  }  ```  This proposal is inspired by the great Generic-based version of Enum.TryParse method laying besides with legacy non-Generic version:  ```  public static bool TryParse(Type enumType, String value, out Object result)  public static bool TryParse<TEnum>(String value, out TEnum result) where TEnum : struct  ```  If proposal to implement Generic version of GetValues will be accepted I guess following Generics-based implementations of GetName GetNames should be implemented for symmetry reason:  ```  public static String GetName<TEnum>(Object value) where TEnum : struct  {      Type enumType = typeof(TEnum);      return enumType.GetEnumName(value);  }    public static String[] GetNames<TEnum>() where TEnum : struct  {      Type enumType = typeof(TEnum);      return enumType.GetEnumNames();  }  ```  I introduce possible implementation of this proposal in [dotnet/coreclr/pull#16557](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16557)    This is a small point improvement suggestion.  It can be implemented separately of as a part of total Enum improvements discussing in [dotnet/corefx/#15453](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/15453)

27448	area-System.Data	Provider-independent mechanism for automatic database command preparation	"ADO.NET has an explicit Prepare() API which can be very important for performance - the effect is dramatic on PostgreSQL and there's a potential for big gains also on Sqlite and on SqlServer (where the operation is currently a no-op, but could obviate sending the query SQL and resultset shape description on each query).    Unfortunately, when using data layers above ADO.NET (dapper, EF Core), it's usually impossible to benefit from preparation as the `DbCommand` API is hidden away. Npgsql deals with this problem via an internal, opt-in ""autoprepare"" feature - it counts the number of times a given SQL has been executed, and once a certain threshold is passed, automatically prepares the command. To avoid preparing too many commands (which could put a strain on the database), an LRU cache ejects old commands.    We should consider promoting this mechanism (or building something similar) to ADO.NET, so that all providers can benefit from it. This mechanism would implement all of the necessary tracking, and would  call `Prepare()` when the proper threshold is passed.    Note: when the threshold is reached, Npgsql currently executes both the preparation and the execution in a single round-trip, this can be important for thrashing scenarios.  Note: we should provide a way for specific providers to opt out of this when preparation really is a no-op (like current SqlClient), to avoid the overhead and added complexity."
27447	area-System.Data	Clarify persistency of prepared commands across pooled connection lifespan	ADO.NET has an explicit `Prepare()` API which can be very important for performance - the effect is dramatic on PostgreSQL and there's a potential for big gains also on Sqlite and on SqlServer (where the operation is currently a no-op, but could obviate sending the query SQL and resultset shape description on each query).    Unfortunately, this feature currently isn't very compatible with short-lived connection scenarios such as web applications: since `Prepare()` is invoked on `DbCommand`, the reasonable expectation from the API is that once the instance is disposed or the DbConnection is closed/disposed, the benefits of preparation disappear. So the benefits of prepare are currently restricted to applications which call `Prepare()` on a `DbCommand` instance, and then re-execute that instance many times on the same `DbConnection` - the opposite of how web applications work.    Since preparation is so important with PostgreSQL, Npgsql works around this problem by internally persisting command - when a prepared `NpgsqlCommand` is disposed, the prepared resources are kept internally on the physical connection, keyed on the SQL, even when the connection is returned to the pool. A subsequent call to `Prepare()` on the same physical connection will just look up those resources and reuse them.    It's worth thinking about this problem in a more general way in ADO.NET, to make sure that other providers benefit from prepared command persistency. This could mean the introduction of a new preparation API or something else.
27446	area-System.IO	Add SafeFindHandle	## Motivation  Handles returned by FindFirstFile on Windows should be closed with FindClose, not CloseHandle. Therefore a SafeFileHandle or similar is not appropriate for it. We have a SafeFindHandle internally, if we expose it publicly it is not necessary to reinvent it.    ## API    ```c#  namespace Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles  {      public sealed partial class SafeFindHandle : Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeHandleZeroOrMinusOneIsInvalid      {          protected override bool ReleaseHandle() { throw null; }      }  }  ```    ## Implementation     ```c#      internal sealed class SafeFindHandle : SafeHandle      {          protected override bool ReleaseHandle()          {              return Interop.Kernel32.FindClose(handle);          }      }  ```    cc @JeremyKuhne 
27445	area-System.Threading	Allocation-free awaitable async operations with ValueTask<T> and ValueTask	## Background  `ValueTask<T>` is currently a discriminated union of a `T` and a `Task<T>`.  This lets APIs that are likely to complete synchronously and return a value do so without allocating a `Task<T>` object to carry the result value.  However, operations that complete asynchronously still need to allocate a `Task<T>`.  There is no non-generic `ValueTask` counterpart today because if you have an operation that completes synchronously and successfully, you can just return `Task.CompletedTask`, no allocation.    That addresses the 80% case where synchronously completing operations no longer allocate.  But for cases where you want to strive to address the 20% case of operations completing asynchronously and still not allocating, you’re forced to play tricks with custom awaitables, which are one-offs, don’t compose well, and generally aren’t appropriate for public surface area.  `Task` and `Task<T>`, by design, never go from a completed to incomplete state, meaning you can’t reuse the same object; this has many usability benefits, but for APIs that really care about that last pound of performance, in particular around allocations, it can get in the way.    We have a bunch of new APIs in .NET Core 2.1 that return `ValueTask<T>`s, e.g. `Stream.ReadAsync`, `ChannelReader.ReadAsync`, `PipeReader.ReadAsync`, etc.  In many of these cases, we’ve simply accepted that they might allocate; in others, custom APIs have been introduced specific to that method.  Neither of these is a good place to be.    ## Proposal  I have implemented a new feature in `ValueTask<T>` and a counterpart non-generic `ValueTask` that lets these not only wrap a `T` result or a `Task<T>`, but also another arbitrary object that implements the `IValueTaskSource<T>` interface (or `IValueTaskSource` for the non-generic `ValueTask`).  An implementation of that interface can be reused, pooled, etc., allowing for an implementation that returns a `ValueTask<T>` or `ValueTask` to have amortized non-allocating operations, both synchronously completing and asynchronously completing.    ### The enabling APIs  First, we need to add these interfaces:  ```C#  namespace System.Threading.Tasks  {      public interface IValueTaskSource      {          bool IsCompleted { get; }          bool IsCompletedSuccessfully { get; }          void OnCompleted(Action<object> continuation, object state, ValueTaskSourceOnCompletedFlags flags);          void GetResult();      }        public interface IValueTaskSource<out TResult>      {          bool IsCompleted { get; }          bool IsCompletedSuccessfully { get; }          void OnCompleted(Action<object> continuation, object state, ValueTaskSourceOnCompletedFlags flags);          TResult GetResult();      }        [Flags]      public enum ValueTaskSourceOnCompletedFlags      {          None = 0x0,          UseSchedulingContext = 0x1,          FlowExecutionContext = 0x2,      }  }  ```  An object implements `IValueTaskSource` to be wrappable by `ValueTask`, and `IValueTaskSource<TResult>` to be wrappable by `ValueTask<TResult>`.    Then we add this ctor to `ValueTask<TResult>`:  ```C#  namespace System.Threading.Tasks  {      public struct ValueTask<TResult>      {          public ValueTask(IValueTaskSource<TResult> source);          ...      }  }  ```    Then we add a non-generic `ValueTask` counterpart to `ValueTask<TResult>`.  This mirrors the `ValueTask<TResult>` surface area, except that it doesn’t have a `Result` property, doesn’t have a ctor that takes a `TResult`, uses `Task` in places where `Task<TResult>` was used, etc.  ```C#  namespace System.Threading.Tasks  {      [AsyncMethodBuilder(typeof(AsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder))]      public readonly partial struct ValueTask : IEquatable<ValueTask>      {          public ValueTask(Task task);          public ValueTask(IValueTaskSource source);          public bool IsCanceled { get; }          public bool IsCompleted { get; }          public bool IsCompletedSuccessfully { get; }          public bool IsFaulted { get; }          public Task AsTask();          public ConfiguredValueTaskAwaitable ConfigureAwait(bool continueOnCapturedContext);          public override bool Equals(object obj);          public bool Equals(ValueTask other);          public ValueTaskAwaiter GetAwaiter();          public override int GetHashCode();          public static bool operator ==(ValueTask left, ValueTask right);          public static bool operator !=(ValueTask left, ValueTask right);      }  }  ```    And finally we add the System.Runtime.CompilerServices goo that allows `ValueTask` to be awaited and used as the return type of an async method:  ```C#  namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices  {      public struct AsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder      {          public static AsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder Create();            public void Start<TStateMachine>(ref TStateMachine stateMachine) where TStateMachine : IAsyncStateMachine;          public void SetStateMachine(IAsyncStateMachine stateMachine);          public void AwaitOnCompleted<TAwaiter, TStateMachine>(ref TAwaiter awaiter, ref TStateMachine stateMachine) where TAwaiter : INotifyCompletion where TStateMachine : IAsyncStateMachine;          public void AwaitUnsafeOnCompleted<TAwaiter, TStateMachine>(ref TAwaiter awaiter, ref TStateMachine stateMachine) where TAwaiter : ICriticalNotifyCompletion where TStateMachine : IAsyncStateMachine;            public void SetResult();          public void SetException(Exception exception);          public ValueTask Task;      }        public readonly struct ValueTaskAwaiter : ICriticalNotifyCompletion      {          public bool IsCompleted { get; }          public void GetResult() { }          public void OnCompleted(Action continuation);          public void UnsafeOnCompleted(Action continuation);     }        public readonly struct ConfiguredValueTaskAwaitable      {          public ConfiguredValueTaskAwaiter GetAwaiter();          public readonly struct ConfiguredValueTaskAwaiter : ICriticalNotifyCompletion          {              public bool IsCompleted { get; }              public void GetResult();              public void OnCompleted(Action continuation);              public void UnsafeOnCompleted(Action continuation);          }      }  }  ```    ### Changes to Previously Accepted APIs  At the very least, we would use the `ValueTask` and `ValueTask<T>` types in the following previously accepted/implemented APIs that are shipping in 2.1:  - **Pipelines**. Instead of pipelines having a custom `PipeAwaiter<T>` type, it will return `ValueTask<T>` from the `ReadAsync` and `FlushAsync` methods that currently return `PipeAwaiter`.  `PipeAwaiter<T>` will be deleted. `Pipe` uses this to reuse the same pipe object over and over so that reads and flushes are allocation-free.  - **Channels**. The `WaitToReadAsync` and `WaitToWriteAsync` methods will return `ValueTask<bool>` instead of `Task<bool>`. The `WriteAsync` method will return `ValueTask` instead of `Task`. At least some of the channel implementations, if not all, will pool and reuse objects backing these value tasks.  - **Streams**. The new `WriteAsync(ReadOnlyMemory<byte>, CancellationToken)` overload will return `ValueTask` instead of `Task`. `Socket`’s new `ReceiveAsync`/`SendAsync` methods that are already defined to return `ValueTask<int>` will take advantage of this support, making sending and receiving on a socket allocation free.  `NetworkStream` will then expose that functionality via `ReadAsync`/`WriteAsync`. `FileStream` will potentially also pool so as to make synchronous and asynchronous reads/writes allocation-free.  - **WebSockets**. The new `SendAsync(ReadOnlyMemory<byte>, …)` overload will return `ValueTask` instead of `Task`. Many `SendAsync` calls just pass back the result from the underlying `NetworkStream`, so this will incur the benefits mentioned above.    There are likely to be other opportunities in the future as well.  And we could re-review some of the other newly added APIs in .NET Core 2.1, e.g. `TextWriter.WriteLineAsync(ReadOnlyMemory<char>, ...)`, to determine if we want to change those from returning `Task` to `ValueTask`. The tradeoff is one of `Task`'s usability vs the future potential for additional optimization.    ### Limitations  `Task` is powerful, in large part due to its “once completed, never go back” design.  As a result, a `ValueTask<T>` that wraps either a `T` or a `Task<T>` has similar power.  A `ValueTask<T>` that wraps an `IValueTaskSource<T>` can be used only in much more limited ways:  - The 99.9% use case: either directly await the operation (e.g. `await SomethingAsync();`), await it with configuration (e.g. `await SomethingAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);`), or get a Task out (e.g. `Task t = SomethingAsync().AsTask();`).  Using `AsTask()` incurs allocation if the `ValueTask`/`ValueTask<T>` wraps something other than a `Task`/`Task<T>`.  - Once you’ve either awaited the `ValueTask`/`ValueTask<T>` or called `AsTask`, you must never touch it again.  - With a `ValueTask<T>` that wraps a `Task<T>`, today you can call `GetAwaiter().GetResult()`, and if it hasn’t completed yet, it will block.  That is unsupported for a `ValueTask<T>` wrapping an `IValueTaskSource<T>`, and thus should be generally discouraged unless you're sure of what it's wrapping. `GetResult` must only be used once the operation has completed, as is guaranteed by the await pattern.  - With a `ValueTask<T>` that wraps a `Task<T>`, you can await it an unlimited number of times, both serially and in parallel.  That is unsupported for a `ValueTask<T>` wrapping an `IValueTaskSource<T>`; it can be `await`ed/`AsTask`'d once and only once.  - With a `ValueTask<T>` that wraps a `Task<T>`, you can call any other operations in the interim and then await the `ValueTask<T>`.  That is unsupported for a `ValueTask<T>` wrapping an `IValueTaskSource<T>`; it should be `await`ed/`AsTask`’d immediately, as the underlying implementation may be used for other operation, subject to whatever the library author chose to do.  - You can choose to explicitly call `IsCompletedSuccessfully` and then use `Result` or `GetAwaiter().GetResult()`, but that is the only coding pattern outside of `await`/`AsTask` that’s supported.  We will need to document that `ValueTask`/`ValueTask<T>` should only be used in these limited patterns unless you know for sure what it wraps and that the wrapped object supports what's being done.  And APIs that return a `ValueTask`/`ValueTask<T>` will need to be clear on the limitations, in hopes of preserving our ability to change the backing store behind `ValueTask<T>` in the future, e.g. an API that we ship in 2.1 that returns `ValueTask<T>` around a `Task<T>` then in the future instead wrapping an `IValueTaskSource<T>`.    Finally, note that as with any solution that involves object reuse and pooling, usability/diagnostics/debuggability are impacted.  If an object is used after it's already been effectively freed, strange/bad behaviors can result.    ### Why now?  If we don’t ship this in 2.1, we will be unable to do so as effectively in the future:  - Some methods (e.g. the new `Stream.WriteAsync` overload) are currently defined to return `Task` but should be changed to return `ValueTask`.  - Some methods return `ValueTask<T>`, but if we’re not explicit about the limitations of how it should be used, it’ll be a breaking change to modify what it backs in the future.  - Various types (e.g. `PipeAwaiter<T>`) will be instant legacy.  - Prior to .NET Core 2.1, `ValueTask<T>` was just OOB.  It’s now also in System.Private.CoreLib, with core types like `Stream` depending on it.    ### Implementation Status  With the exception of pipelines, I have these changes implemented across coreclr and corefx.  I can respond to any changes from API review, clean things up, and get it submitted as PRs across coreclr and corefx.  Due to the breaking changes in existing APIs, it will require some coordination across the repos.    (EDIT stephentoub 2/25: Renamed IValueTaskObject to IValueTaskSource.)  (EDIT stephentoub 2/25: Changed OnCompleted to accept object state.)

27439	area-System.Data	Dont allow exceptions to emerge on the threadpool	PoolCreateRequest handles creation of new connections on the thread pool. However when an exception occurs, it is bubbled up to the thread pool. This is a regression from .Net Framework and causes applications using Min Pool Size to crash.     The solution is to catch all exceptions during connection open and to swallow them. This will not change the exception that app sees from Connection Pool, as the error is bubbled up from another code path where the errorWaitHandle is set during connection Open.     The test added, makes sure that we can open 3 bad connections using MinPoolSize. Before the fix, the test would crash after the first exception.

Since the exception type can't really be changed because of backwards compatibility, that leaves the exception message. Maybe it could be changed to something like the following?    > Error in dynamic binding: The best overloaded constructor match for 'System.Net.Http.StringContent.StringContent(string, System.Text.Encoding, string)' has some invalid arguments:  > Argument 1: cannot convert from 'int' to 'string'    Do you agree that this is something that should be improved?

27418	area-System.IO	API Proposal: Path Span APIs that write into a specified buffer	We've added `System.IO.Path` overloads that take spans and output strings. To facilitate additional scenarios we should create overloads that allow you to specify the buffer to write to, rather than creating a string. `Path.GetFullPath` and `Path.Combine` are the key APIs here.    We've added the following for 2.1:    ``` C#  namespace System.IO  {      public static class Path      {          public static bool TryJoin(ReadOnlySpan<char> path1, ReadOnlySpan<char> path2, Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);          public static bool TryJoin(ReadOnlySpan<char> path1, ReadOnlySpan<char> path2, ReadOnlySpan<char> path3, Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten)      }  }  ```    What we'd like to consider adding:    ``` C#  namespace System.IO  {      public static class Path      {          public static bool TryGetTempPath(Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);          public static bool TryGetRandomFileName(Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);          public static bool TryGetRelativePath(ReadOnlySpan<char> relativeTo, ReadOnlySpan<char> path, Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);          public static bool TryGetFullPath(ReadOnlySpan<char> path, Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);          public static bool TryGetFullPath(ReadOnlySpan<char> path, ReadOnlySpan<char> basePath, Span<char> destination, out int charsWritten);      }  }  ```    ### Notes    - Often we know what the needed buffer size will likely be, how do / should we express that from the API?     - We don't know positively as the current working directory can be changed, so the char count _can_ change    
27417	area-System.Runtime	[System.Runtime.InteropServices] Introduce broader platform definitions. 	"Unity, Xamarin and Mono users suffers from a historic problem with platform detection. This patch introduces definitions for all the existing platforms that .NET supports beyond .NET Core via Unity and  Xamarin.    To cope with the historical setting that OSX has been used in existing code to probe for an Apple OS (iOS, tvOS, watchOS), we introduce new values for all four apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS) and also return true when probed for the legacy OSX setting.    The same principle is applied to Linux, we will continue to return true, but the more specific versions of Tizen and Android are supported.    The list has been expanded to all the platforms currently supported by Mono and Unity.    # Proposed Changes    The System.Runtime.InteropServices.OSPlatform is updated to surface the following public definitions:    ```csharp          public static OSPlatform Android { get; } = new OSPlatform(""ANDROID"");            public static OSPlatform iOS { get; } = new OSPlatform(""IOS"");     // Returns true for Linux, Tizen and Android systems          public static OSPlatform Linux { get; } = new OSPlatform(""LINUX"");            public static OSPlatform macOS { get; } = new OSPlatform(""MACOS"");            public static OSPlatform N3DS { get; } = new OSPlatform(""3DS"");      // This one has historically been used as ""Apple platforms"", so it returns true   // on iOS, tvOS, macOS, watchOS.          public static OSPlatform OSX { get; } = new OSPlatform(""OSX"");            public static OSPlatform PlayStation4 { get; } = new OSPlatform(""PS4"");            public static OSPlatform PlayStationPortable2 { get; } = new OSPlatform(""PSP2"");            public static OSPlatform PlayStationVita { get; } = new OSPlatform(""PSVITA"");            public static OSPlatform Switch { get; } = new OSPlatform(""SWITCH"");             public static OSPlatform Tizen { get; } = new OSPlatform(""TIZEN"");            public static OSPlatform tvOS { get; } = new OSPlatform(""TVOS"");            public static OSPlatform watchOS { get; } = new OSPlatform(""WATCHOS"");            public static OSPlatform WebAssembly { get; } = new OSPlatform(""WEBASSEMBLY"");            public static OSPlatform WiiU { get; } = new OSPlatform(""WIIU"");            public static OSPlatform Windows { get; } = new OSPlatform(""WINDOWS"");            public static OSPlatform XboxOne { get; } = new OSPlatform(""XBOXONE"");  ```    Additionally, `RuntimeInformation`'s `IsOSPlatform` method is modified to cope with the aliasing described before, and Android and Tizen systems are Linux systems, and macOS, tvOS, iOS and watchOS are reported as OSX systems.    Twist: we could make OSX deprecated as well, and introduce an additional AppleOS definition or a Darwin definition to cover Apple-based OSes.    # PR    A pull request with the first batch is available here:    https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27378    "

27407	area-System.Net	Fix ManagedWebSocket cancellation race condition	When a cancelable cancellation token is passed to Receive/SendAsync, the code registers with the token to abort the web socket.  The resulting exception is then translated into an OperationCanceledException if _abort is true.  But this logic doesn't count on the possibility that the underlying Read/WriteAsync on the transport stream could actually throw a cancellation exception.  If it does, there's a race condition as to whether the web socket's abort flag will be set in time; if it is, we wrap the cancellation exception in another cancellation exception, and if it's not, we treat it as a non-cancellation exception.  This commit fixes that, by explicitly allowing OperationCanceledExceptions to proceed uninterrupted.  This should fix the ReceiveAsync_AfterCancellationDoReceiveAsync_ThrowsWebSocketException test, which recently started failing sporadically, I believe because we improved the cancellation support in SocketsHttpHandler, on top of which ClientWebSocket now sits.

27405	area-System.Security	X509Certificate2Collection.Find() does not return the same certificates as full framework	Hi,    I have a strange issue with handling of certificates from the windows certificate store. On full .NET framework, this code returns the expected certificates, on dotnet core, the very same code does not return any certificates from the store.    The code is the following:    ```  var certificates = new List<X509Certificate2>();    using (var myStore = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser))  {   myStore.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);   var certsWithCorrectUsage = myStore.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByKeyUsage, X509KeyUsageFlags.DataEncipherment.ToString(), true);     foreach (var cert in certsWithCorrectUsage)   {    if (cert.HasPrivateKey)    {     certificates.Add(cert);    }   }  }    return certificates;  ```    When debugging into the `.Find()` method I get down into `FindPal.VerifyCertificateIgnoringErrors()`, and there on the `chainPal.ChainStatus` I see the following error messages:  ```  The signature of the certificate cannot be verified.  A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the tust provider.  ```    I used the following powershell script to generate a root certificate, install it in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities, and create two other test certificates which are signed by this root cert:    [createcerts.ps1.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1751455/createcerts.ps1.txt)    Why doesn't the code on dotnet core find the root certificate, while it obviously seems to be trusted by my machine and also the full framework finds these certificates as valid for the requested purpose.

The suite of tests which were added uncovered other bugs which are being  addressed in this change, as well.  Mainly that RSACng and  RSASecurityTransforms both failed at encrypting zero-length data.  To solve  that problem the RSA padding class can build PKCS#1 encryption padding,  but since the native layers are capable of correctly decrypting the payloads  no unpadding code is needed at this time.

27383	area-System.Net	Split up cookie headers that are added via HttpListenerResponse.WebHeaders.Add	"This fixes an inconsistency between the Windows and Managed implementation of  HttpListenerResponse.    Basically, there are two ways to add cookies to an HttpListenerResponse. The 'usual' way is to add them to the cookie collection:  ```  response.Cookies = cookies;  ```  On Unix and on Windows that yields the following Set-Cookie header:  ```  Set-Cookie: name1=value1, name2=value2  ```  In this case though the user is setting the headers by adding them directly:  ```  foreach (var c in cookies)  {      HttpListenerResponse.Headers.Add(""Set-Cookie"",c);  }  ```  According to the relevant documentation for WebHeaderCollection.Add headers added more than once will be added in a comma separated list. So, even adding the headers directly, we expect the same result. That is true on Unix, and we get the following header:  ```  Set-Cookie: name1=value1,name2=value2  ```  However, on Windows we see an unexpected result:  ```  Set-Cookie: name1=value1  Set-Cookie: name2=value2  ```  While both behaviors are acceptable, I think that the Windows behavior was intentionally added. That is based off of this comment in the relevant code:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/3db29b721a45fb4f300e27c5df5750f57b38ec45/src/System.Net.HttpListener/src/System/Net/Windows/HttpListenerResponse.Windows.cs#L460-L482  This PR ensures that the managed implementation follows the same behavior as the Windows version. I think that should also update the documentation to reflect this behavior, since it seems to be by design.    Fixes: #22910 "
27382	area-System.Net	Use SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO with SystemDefaults	"The current SslStream implementation was applying SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO only when TLS1.2, TLS1.1 and/or TLS1.0 flags were set.   In .NET Core 2.0, we introduced a new TLS option (#13075), called 'SystemDefault', which means to use the best (strongest) TLS security   protocol available in the operating system. But since SystemDefault (equal to all flag bits set to zero) doesn't match any of the TLS bit   masks, we weren't passing in the SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag.    This fix adds a check for SystemDefault and makes sure that the SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag is passed to SCHANNEL.  According to the SCHANNEL experts, the current ""SystemDefault' will actually use strong crypto settings on current Windows OS's.   But they advised us that we should always pass in the SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag when using 'SystemDefault'.    This is related to internal bug 458042."
27380	area-Infrastructure	[release/2.1] Fix build on clang 5 (#27178)	This is a port of https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27178 to the `release/2.1` branch. It lets us build corefx with clang 5.    clang 5 is the default on some platforms supported by .NET Core 2.1, such as Fedora 27.
27379	area-System.Memory	Optimize string-like portable Span APIs for Ordinal and OrdinalIgnoreCase	This is specific to portable span (and not fast span).    We do not need to allocate and call the string APIs when StringComparison is Ordinal or OrdinalIgnoreCase.    Similar to APIs like EndsWith/etc., add a non-allocating code path for CompareTo for Ordinal:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/42d5370f8c6cec8d1961f54a0974e52b0562b0a7/src/System.Memory/src/System/MemoryExtensions.Portable.cs#L23    Also optimize for OrdinalIgnoreCase for all the string-like APIs.

27360	area-System.Net	Fix fragment handling in HttpClient	SocketsHttpHandler isn't sending fragments, nor is it properly inheriting the fragment from the original request URI into the redirect location URI when the original URI had one and the redirect URI did not, even though RFC 7231 says it must.  This commit fixes that for SocketsHttpHandler.    WinHttpHandler also isn't handling this inheritance according to the RFC. It appears that the logic for WinHttpHandler would actually need to be changed in WINHTTP itself, or else WinHttpHandler would need to be changed to do the redirects itself.    Neither CurlHandler or NetFxHandler send fragments at all.    This commit also fixes the test to correctly compare the expected and actual Uris... apparently Uri equality doesn't factor in fragments, so they're first converted to strings.  It also updates the test to also validate that the server received the URI with the fragment included.

27358	area-System.Security	X509Certificate2 unclear error message when attempting to store certificate in non-existent store	"Had a problem where my app would work fine locally, but fail when hosted on azure app services.    I was trying to load a certificate from a file using ```new X509Certificate2(string fileName, string password)```. (Although hrom cursory research the error message is identically as ambiguous with other construction methods)    The error message I received was:  ```  Unhandled Exception: Internal.Cryptography.CryptoThrowHelper+WindowsCryptographicException: The system cannot find the file specified     at Internal.Cryptography.Pal.CertificatePal.FromBlobOrFile(Byte[] rawData, String fileName, String password, X509KeyStorageFlags keyStorageFlags)     at System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate..ctor(String fileName, String password, X509KeyStorageFlags keyStorageFlags)     at System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2..ctor(String fileName)     at ConsoleApplication.Program.Main(String[] args)  ```    The certificate was, indeed, present and was readable from the user running - so it's not an issue that the certificate can't be found!    The actual error is, I believe, that it can't put the certificate the LocalUser's cert store. Info [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20151101033040/http://blog.tylerdoerksen.com:80/2013/08/23/pfx-certificate-files-and-windows-azure-websites/).    I think the culprit is here  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/29cd6a0b0ac2993cee23ebaf36ca3d4bce6dd75f/src/System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates/src/Internal/Cryptography/Pal.Windows/CertificatePal.Import.cs#L150-L152    I believe the last hresult from PFXImportCertStore will be CRYPT_E_NOT_FOUND  ""can't find file"". Which causes ambiguity between ""can't find the given certificate file to import"" and ""got an error when trying to put the certificate after trying to put it in a store"".    Not sure how you'd go about solving this as we're only returned CRYPT_E_NOT_FOUND for failed imports regardless of reason.    Repro:  1. Create a web app that pulls a certificate from a file  2. ```new X509Certificate2(string fileName, string password)```  3. Upload and run on azure app services  4. Pull hair out for 2h wondering why it can't find a file that blatantly exists.    Workaround:  Store it in the MachineKey set  ```new X509Certificate2(filePath,  pass, X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet);```"

27355	area-System.Net	HttpWebRequest/HttpWebResponse never releases connection after http server error (.Net Core 2.0.1, Debian 8)	"I'm running a .Net Core Console App under Debian 8, which constantly queries a REST server via HTTPS.  The app uses plain syncronous http calls using HttpWebRequest / HttpWebResponse .  I noticed that after some hours of operation all calls raise exceptions with description ""Too many open files"", meaning that there are too many connections left non-closed.  After some investigation I figured out that each time the http server responds with non-200 status code (for example, 5хх server errors of 429 Too many requests), even after disposing HttpWebResponse the connection remains open but is never reused by ServicePoint manager for next HttpWebRequest, even for the same host/URL. After a significant amount of errors the open file limit (default 4096) is exhausted an no further requests are possible. The connections are never released until the dotnet process is killed.    Actions to reproduce he problem:    1. I wrote a simple php script `getstatus.php` and placed it on a test web serer. The script emulates http error. It accepts a numeric code as GET query and responds with same HTTP code. The response body always  contains the same - the resquest headers. When requesting `https://myserver/getstatus.php` or  `https://myserver/getstaus.php?200` I get normal response. When requesting `https://myserver/getstaus.php?500` I get same content, but with 500 status code (""Internal server error"") etc.  The php code is below:  ```php  <?php  $code=$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];  if ($code) {   http_response_code($code);  };  echo ""Request headers:         <br /> \n"";  foreach (getallheaders() as $name => $value) {      echo ""$name: $value         <br />\n"";  }  ?>  ```    2. The sample vb.net code for quering the server. The program accepts a numeric code as argument and makes 100 requests to test server:    ```vb  Imports System  Imports System.IO  Imports System.Net  Imports System.Threading    Module Program      Private Const USER_AGENT = ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.167 Safari/537.36""        Sub Main(args As String())          Dim result As String          For counter = 1 To 100              If args.Count < 1 Then                  Console.WriteLine(""Launched without arguments"")                  result = DownloadString(""https://mytestserver/getstatus.php"")              Else                  Console.WriteLine(""Launched with argument: {0}"", args(0))                  result = DownloadString(""https://mytestserver/getstatus.php?"" & args(0))              End If              Console.WriteLine(""Respone content > "" & result)              Thread.Sleep(500)          Next          Console.ReadLine()      End Sub        Private Function GetResult(ByRef w As HttpWebRequest) As String          Try              Using r As HttpWebResponse = w.GetResponse                  Console.WriteLine(""Response status > "" & r.StatusCode)                  Console.WriteLine(""Response headers > "" & r.Headers.ToString)                  Using s As Stream = r.GetResponseStream                      Using rd As StreamReader = New StreamReader(s)                          Dim st As String = rd.ReadToEnd                          Return st                      End Using                  End Using              End Using          Catch ex As webException              Console.WriteLine(""Catch in GetResult(): "" & ex.Message)          End Try        End Function        Private Function DownloadString(ByVal __Url As String) As String          Try              Dim w As HttpWebRequest = CType(WebRequest.Create(__Url), HttpWebRequest)              w.UserAgent = USER_AGENT              w.KeepAlive = True              w.Timeout = 10000              w.ReadWriteTimeout = 10000              Console.WriteLine(""Requesting "" & __Url)              Return GetResult(w)          Catch ex As Exception              Console.WriteLine(""Catch in DownloadString(): "" & ex.Message)          End Try      End Function    End Module  ```  I use VS 2017 Community to write the code. The project was created using a "".Net Core Console application"" template with no additional changes to project configuration. The target platform is shown as "".NET Core 2.0""  The project is compiled under VS, then published to a folder, then the folder contents are transferred to the Debian 8 machine (VPS) and run like `dotnet myproj.dll`    3. To count open file handles I use a bash script found on StackOverflow  ```bash  cd /proc  for pid in [0-9]*  do      echo ""PID = $pid with $(ls /proc/$pid/fd/ | wc -l) file descriptors""  done | sort -rn -k5 | head | while read -r _ _ pid _ fdcount _  do    command=$(ps -o cmd -p ""$pid"" -hc)    printf ""pid = %5d with %4d fds: %s\n"" ""$pid"" ""$fdcount"" ""$command""  done  ```    4. Actual testing  4.1. Run `dotnet myproj.dll`. On a separate session monitor open file count with the above script. In my case there are no more than 42 open files for the dotnet process, from start to finish.    4.2. Run `dotnet myproj.dll 500` emulating http errors. Each attempt to get httpwebresponse object results in exception which is logged to console. After each error the number of open files for dotnet process increases by 3 (!). After 100 ""unsuccessful"" requests the open file count reaches 344 (started at 42).  Note that all objects for response handling are wrapped in `using`, so they should be disposed properly after exception, and tcp connection should be released for reusing for next calls. I might be wrong, but current behavior is a bug.    During further experiments I found a workaround. If I completely read a ResponseStream of WebException.Response object, the connection seems to be released, and total connection count does not increse. The `Catch` block in `GetResponse` function should containg following lines:  ```vb  Catch ex As webException              Console.WriteLine(""Catch in GetResult(): "" & ex.Message)              Console.WriteLine(""WebException.Reponse.Headers: "" & ex.Response.Headers.ToString)              Using s As Stream = ex.Response.GetResponseStream                  Using rd As StreamReader = New StreamReader(s)                      Dim st As String = rd.ReadToEnd                      Return st                  End Using              End Using          End Try  ```  But this seems to be redundant because in many cases servers don't return any meaningful info after http error in the response body, so reading it is unneeded work and anyway non-intuinive way of programming.  Thanks for attention and please don't mind any mistakes, I'm not a professiona l programmer.                           "
27354	area-System.Net	SSL certificate validation on Windows 7 with .Net Framework is ignored after a connection to port different than 443 was established	"- Steps to reproduce:    1. Create/find a server that hosts 2 SSL endpoins on port 443 and port 10443 (probably any port different that 443) - the IP address of the two endpoints should be the same, the server certificates of the endpoints should be self-signed and different.  2. Build the following code for **net471**:  ```c#            static void Main(string[] args)          {             string host = ""your server IP"";             MakeRequest(host, 10443);             MakeRequest(host, 443);          }           private static void MakeRequest(string host, int port) {            HttpRequestMessage webRequest =               new HttpRequestMessage(                  HttpMethod.Get,                  $""https://{host}:{port}/"");            webRequest.Version = new Version(1, 1);              var handler = new HttpClientHandler {               ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback =                  (sender, cert, chain, errors) => true            };            HttpClient client = new HttpClient(handler);              client.SendAsync(webRequest).Wait();         }  ```  3. Run the following code to connect to that server **on Windows 7 64-bit**    - Expected result:  The code should complete without errors    - Actual result:  There is an exception:    ```  System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request.   System.Net.WebException: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.  ```    **This does not reproduce on Windows 10.**    Considering that this API is part of the .Net Standard 2.0 API, it affects portable code running on Windows 7 and on .Net Framework.    The issue is also observed on all net451+ frameworks on Windows 7. The  test for those frameworks uses the ```WebRequestHandler``` as it is the only one that has a certificate validation support.    I think it has something to do with the ServicePointManager and it reusing of connections as reducing the MaxServicePointIdleTime seems to have some effect (though in the distilled repro above I couldn't make it pass).    If the order of the request is changed so that the connection to the port 443 is established first, then the connection to port 10443 is ok.  "

27334	area-System.Runtime	StringBuilder should allow copying efficiently to a TextWriter	## Motivation    At present to copy a StringBuilder into a TextWriter you must allocate a throwaway string as large as the amount you want to copy. This can cause a LOH allocation.    ## Workaround     To avoid that today you must write code to copy in blocks via a char[] buffer. ASP.NET were forced to do this ([PR here](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetWebStack/commit/3fe0d348f00864e4f1eeaefbd027ea965787b892#diff-fe84a6b0645ee996bea1ec4d8445823f)) in response to an issue in a customer workload.    If we add an API for StringBuilder to copy to a TextWriter, we can take care of that loop, and also use a pooled char[].    ## Proposed API    ```c#      public sealed partial class StringBuilder : System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable      {           // existing          public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, char[] destination, int destinationIndex, int count) { }          public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, System.Span<char> destination, int count) { }            // proposed          public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, TextWriter destination, int count) { }      }  ```    ## Rough Implementation    Basically [what ASP.NET did](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetWebStack/blob/62d0b2df0bcca848a8e0848fd1866928df15528e/src/System.Web.WebPages/StringWriterExtensions.cs#L15) but using a pooled char[] buffer.    ```c#  public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, TextWriter destination, int count)   {               int remainingChars = this.Length;              int bufferSize = Math.Min(this.Length,  1024);                char[] buffer = ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Rent(bufferSize);              int currentPosition = 0;                while (remainingChars > 0)              {                  int copyLen = Math.Min(bufferSize, remainingChars);                    this.CopyTo(currentPosition, buffer, copyLen);                    destination.Write(buffer, 0, copyLen);                    currentPosition += copyLen;                  remainingChars -= copyLen;              }               ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Return(buffer);  }  ````

27324	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler may corrupt pooled connection if send content is canceled	When a connection is about to be returned to the pool, we're nulling out the _currentRequest field, which then causes the send content to stop sending if it's still going.

Should this attribute use the same regex validation method as its [Framework equivalent](https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations/DataAnnotations/EmailAddressAttribute.cs#L54), which seems much more robust?

27304	area-System.Runtime	Check if app is run by sudo/admin on Linux	@maroallegro commented on [Mon Jan 29 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1244)  I am trying to check if .NetCore code is running as sudo/admin on Linux. It works on Windows but throws exception on Linux.    How do I check if app is run by admin/sudo on Ubuntu Linux by using .NET Core2.0 build-in class?    Here is the code I have tried (however i thought that it will not manage admin rights on Linux):  ```  using System;  using System.Security.Principal;    namespace smallTestsCore  {      class Program      {          static void Main(string[] args)          {              Console.WriteLine(Program.IsAdministrator);              Console.ReadLine();          }          public static bool IsAdministrator =>              new WindowsPrincipal(WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent())                  .IsInRole(WindowsBuiltInRole.Administrator);      }  }  ```  The code works on Windows, but does not work on Linux:    ```  Exception has occurred: CLR/System.PlatformNotSupportedException  An unhandled exception of type 'System.PlatformNotSupportedException' occurred in  System.Security.Principal.Windows.dll: 'Windows Principal functionality is not supported on this platform.'    at System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent()     at adminTst.Program.get_IsAdministrator() in /home/user/adminTst/Program.cs:line 15     at adminTst.Program.Main(String[] args) in /home/user/adminTst/Program.cs:line 11  ```

27299	area-System.ComponentModel	System.ComponentModel.Composition is missing a typeforward for Lazy<T,TMetadata>	"@joperezr and I noticed this when having a discussion.    System.ComponentModel.Composition reference assembly is missing a type-forward for System.Lazy<T, TMetadata>.    As a result, when you use a .NET assembly which makes use of this type and reference System.ComponentModel.Composition, you will see a compile error.    ```  Error CS0012 The type 'Lazy<,>' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.ComponentModel.Composition, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.  ```    See attached sample.  [LazySample.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1742137/LazySample.zip)    We should fix this by added the typeforward to the ref.     This also raises the question of  ""what goes in netcoreapp2.1""?  We can't remove System.ComponentModel.Composition.dll since that will be a breaking change.  It was present in 2.0 in order to typeforward this one type to System.Runtime.  Should we include all of MEF? /cc @weshaggard @danmosemsft   "

27295	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: should validate request after chained handlers execute	The code in `SocketsHttpHandler::ValidateAndNormalizeRequest` is performing some checks on request validity, e.g. don't allow chunked encoding if there's no content.    These checks happen before the chained handlers (redirect, auth, etc) execute.  Because of this, it's possible that one of these handlers could modify the request to be invalid.  (In fact, we hit this previously because the redirect handler was changing POST to GET and clearing content but not removing Transfer-Encoding: chunked.)    Just to be safe, we should at least consider moving the validation logic to execute after the chained handers run, but before we try to establish a connection.

This matches WinHttpHandler/CurlHandler.    This does not match full framework behavior, though.  Framework will simply stop redirecting and return the last 3xx response.    The latter seems slightly better to me.  However, it also means the user needs to handle this case and not assume a 200 response.  They pretty much have to do this anyway since the response could always be 4xx or 5xx anyway, but it's still one more situation for them to handle.

27279	area-System.IO	GZipStream cannot decompress multipart gzip files. 	"See the following [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47743788/gzipstream-from-memorystream-only-returns-a-few-hundred-bytes  ) for more information.    GZipStream currently fails if you try to decompress a concatenated gzip file. The RFC does state that two gzip files can be cated together and it is also a valid gzip file. However, the current implementation can only read the first gzip stream and stops there. Here is a simple repro::  ```cs  using System;  using System.IO;  using System.IO.Compression;  class Program  {      static void Main()      {          using (var fs = new FileStream(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory,""test.txt.gz""), FileMode.Create))          {              using(var gz = new GZipStream(fs, CompressionLevel.NoCompression, true))              using(var sw = new StreamWriter(gz))                  sw.WriteLine(""Stream 1"");                                using(var gz = new GZipStream(fs, CompressionLevel.NoCompression, true))              using(var sw = new StreamWriter(gz))                  sw.WriteLine(""Stream 2"");                            fs.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);              using (var gz = new GZipStream(fs, CompressionMode.Decompress))              using (var sr = new StreamReader(gz))              Console.WriteLine(sr.ReadToEnd());          }      }  }  ```    The expected output should be  ```  Stream 1  Stream 2  ```  But the actual output is just `Stream 1`.    If you open up ""test.txt.gz"" in your favorite gzip util, like 7z, you will be able to extract the file and you will see the correct output."

(double byte - 50MB file)  - There are 100MB of StringBuilder allocations.    ## API Proposal  ```csharp  namespace System.Text.RegularExpressions  {      public class Regex      {          // Returns amount of bytes written into the buffer          public static int Replace(ReadOnlySpan<char> input, Span<char> buffer, string pattern, string replacement, RegexOptions options = RegexOptions.None, TimeSpan matchTimeout = default);      }  }  ```    ## Notes  This API would help us remove unnecessary string allocations in the regex-redux benchmark (http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=regexredux&lang=csharpcore&id=9).  The Regex.Replace implementation uses Match internally to check the pattern on the input string. Can we also change the Match code to operate on Spans or do we need to allocate a string in that step?    ## Sample Usage  ```csharp  // Sample implementation for regex-redux  const int InputFileSize = 1024 * 1024 * 50; // 50 MB input file    // Borrow buffers   char[] buffer1Arr = ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Rent(InputFileSize);   char[] buffer2Arr = ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Rent(InputFileSize);   Span<char> buffer1 = new Span<char>(buffer1Arr);   Span<char> buffer2 = new Span<char>(buffer2Arr);    int bufferBytesWritten = Console.In.ReadBlock(buffer1);  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer1.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer2, ""tHa[Nt]"", ""<4>"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer2.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer1, ""aND|caN|Ha[DS]|WaS"", ""<3>"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer1.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer2, ""a[NSt]|BY"", ""<2>"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer2.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer1, ""<[^>]*>"", ""|"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer1.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer2, ""\\|[^|][^|]*\\|"", ""-"");    // Return buffers  ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Return(buffer1Arr);  ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Return(buffer2Arr);    return bufferBytesWritten;  ```    Relates to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27124    cc @stephentoub @danmosemsft @vancem @jkotas @jfree"

I'd noticed in a project of mine that the `TextWriter` overload of `WebUtility.HtmlEncode` was unexpectedly generating garbage.    I added a `System.Buffers` project reference to the `System.Runtime.Extensions` csproj and wrote a simple implementation of `StringBuilder` based on `ArrayPool`, as suggested by @jkotas in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/13875.

27246	area-System.IO	Add PipeReader and PipeWriter implementations over a Stream	This will help with adoption of pipelines. This is possible today but we can provide an implementation with minimal allocations. The usual adapter code involves creating 2 pipes and creating 2 async loops that read from the stream and write into the pipe and reading from the pipe and writing into the Stream.    This works well but there are some downsides:  - Some streams buffer internally and we may end up copying from the Stream's internal buffer into the pipe's buffers.  - Even if we can avoid that, we'll end up allocating a Task per read and write operation (though some streams cache the result of the previous operation)  - We end up paying per read/write costs in general (for e.g. in FileStream allocating via ThreadPoolBoundHandle.AllocateNativeOverlapped per read/write pair).    Most of the per read/write costs can be mitigated by using CopyToAsync (if overridden by the Stream) but there are some downsides there as well.  - Using the default implementations CopyToAsync allocates an internal buffer if the Stream doesn't have one already and passes that buffer to the other stream. Using the default pipe implementation, we end up copying the Stream's buffer into the pipe's buffer which might be fine but is a bit unfortunate.    We can avoid some of these overheads if we implement a PipeReader on top of CopyToAsync that doesn't use the Pipe internally. The idea here is that we call CopyToAsync on a fake stream that forwards WriteAsync calls to the PipeReader consumer. This implementation would pass buffers directly from the Stream to the consumer. If the consumer doesn't process the entire buffer, only the unconsumed buffer is copied into an internal buffer for the next read.    The write side isn't as problematic because we need to be able to allocate memory to write into the Stream so reusing the pipe isn't so bad here. The implementation here would likely be using a Pipe internally, then writing to the Stream on FlushAsync.
27245	area-System.Net	HttpContent auto-computed content length header is not exposed via header enumeration	"If you access HttpContent.Headers.ContentLength directly, we will attempt to use the content's TryComputeLength to construct a content length header.    However, if you access HttpContent.Headers via its enumerator or a method like TryGetValues, we won't construct the content length header.    This means that just accessing the ContentLength property will change the results of header enumeration.  For example:    ```csharp              var content = new StringContent(""hello world"");              foreach (var kvp in content.Headers) { }    // Content-Length not present              var ignore = content.Headers.ContentLength;              foreach (var kvp in content.Headers) { }    // Content-Length present  ```    Similarly, if you try to remove the header using the Remove method, it's not actually removed:    ```csharp              var content = new StringContent(""hello world"");              content.Headers.Remove(""Content-Length"");              Assert.Equal(null, content.Headers.ContentLength);  // fails; returns value from TryComputeLength  ```    The easiest fix here is probably just to try to compute the length when the content object is constructed.  This assumes that TryComputeLength is always cheap, which seems reasonable, but is slightly different than how it's used today.  Also, it seems like LoadIntoBufferAsync changes the Content-Length, but probably this is fine.    Unfortunately, fixing this will cause SocketsHttpHandler to behave incorrectly.  Currently, if you set TransferEncodingChunked = true, then SocketsHttpHandler will never access the ContentLength property directly, and thus it won't get populated and won't get sent on the wire.  Fixing the above behavior will cause the ContentLength to get populated, and thus sent on the wire, which is not correct behavior, per RFC.  So this will need to get fixed somehow.  (Note that this problem exists today, it's just harder to hit it -- you would need to either set Content-Length explicitly, or force population of the header by accessing it.)    (edited because I'm an idiot and can't read the RFC properly)  "

That way, if the server is unresponsive, we don't need to wait for the full HttpClient timeout to cancel the request, and conversely, setting a small HttpClient timeout to avoid such issues doesn't cancel an active operation taking a long time simply because it's conversing a lot.    We should add:  ```C#  public sealed class SocketsHttpHandler  {      public TimeSpan ConnectTimeout { get; set; } // defaults to infinite so that it's opt-in / pay for play      ...  }  ```
27234	area-Infrastructure	Consider making a property-based testing library available for tests.	Consider making a property-based testing library, such as [FsCheck](https://github.com/fscheck/FsCheck), available for use in testing.    In particular, [model-based testing](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/StatefulTesting.html) would be useful for dealing with things like the [XML.LINQ](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Private.Xml.Linq/tests/events/EventsAdd.cs) property tests, making it easier to write combinatorial tests that search through more possibilities.    Now, it's true that FsCheck, like most libraries based on Quickcheck, normally use a random seed on each run; this is considered a feature.  However, they all explicitly include the failing seed for any failing test in the output, and this can be included in the config for the test (meaning regression tests can be automatically re-run)

Event is raised properly if we listen in `/tmp/realdir` instead.

That didn't happen though (no events being raised, I also tested with other event types).

27231	area-System.Net	Several perf improvements/tweaks for SocketsHttpHandler	- Chunked reads from buffer.  We now process as much of the buffer as we can synchronously during ReadAsync, rather than returning once we hit the end of a chunk.  For very small chunks that arrive quickly, this results in a huge perf increase, e.g. best case for the optimization, with lots of 1-byte chunks getting buffered together, it's now 10x faster.  With 100-byte chunks buffered together, it's 2x faster.    - Blitting byte[] to output for known headers.  Rather than using WriteStringAsync to output all header names, we now use WriteBytesAsync for known headers, with the headers precomputed into byte[]s and cached.    - Cached `Task<int>`s for ReadAsync.  Hopefully consumers start moving to the new `ReadAsync(Memory<byte>, CancellationToken)` overload on Stream, but for those who consume via `ReadAsync(byte[], int, int)`, we need to allocate a task even for synchronously completing values, which will be common when reading from a buffer.  We now cache `Task<int>`s for values < 1024, to account for small reads.    - Removed delegate/closure allocation from connection.  We were accidentally closing over a cancellation token, resulting in an extra delegate and closure allocation in ConnectHelper.  Also reduced the size of the EstablishSslConnectionAsync state machine by splitting the method in order to remove several arguments from being included.    - Use Utf8Formatter for hex values.  Switched from custom formatting of hex values to just use Utf8Formatter.TryFormat.    - Avoid buffering in HttpConnection.CopyToAsync(Stream).  This is used when we want to copy the whole source stream until EOF (e.g. for a Connection: close response), and thus we can skip the buffer and use the source stream's CopyToAsync directly.    - Added a test to exercise various size chunks, line endings, ReadAsync vs CopyToAsync, etc.    - Fix CopyToAsync cancellation handling.  Even though we'll abort the connection when cancellation is requested, we still need to pass the token to the destination stream's WriteAsync to give it the opportunity to cancel.  Also properly pass the buffer size through to the underlying stream's CopyToAsync where appropriate.    - Small miscellaneous cleanup, like removing a few unused arguments from methods, fixing an assert to validate the right thing, etc.    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27198  cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @wfurt, @Priya91

27227	area-System.Runtime	TimeZoneInfo incredibly slow	"The TimeZoneInfo methods ConvertTimeToUtc, IsAmbiguousTime and IsDayLightSavingTime popped up as eating up about half of the processing time in a program importing, converting and storing lots of data in a database, As this was quite unbelievable to me, I programmed a little converter, which did  these same conversions for our time zone ""W. Europe Standard Time"" and found it to be about 70 times as fast as the dotnet implementation.  I tried to figure out what went wrong in TimeZoneInfo implementation, but it looked pretty complicated (even messed up) to me, and as I only have limited time resources thought, that someone responsible for this code should check this out instead.   I know my comparison is only valid for our W.European timezone, but I think that most time zones are similarily easy to implement, so for these types of zones the dotnet code really should perform much better. Performance should really be an issue here, as time-related functionality is offen used in comination with engineering and measurment data, where converting between local timezones and UTC is very frequent, and needs to be fast.

27209	area-System.Security	Normalize names of span inputs in crypto API	"The asymmetric types operate on either hashed input, or unprocessed input.  The existing API tends to call hashed input ""hash"" (or ""rgbHash"" for older API),  and unprocessed input ""data"" (or ""rgbData"").    This change modifies the new (ReadOnly)Span-based methods to use ""data""  and ""hash"" (as appropriate) instead of ""source"".  Particularly because the  hash-based methods in DSA do not contain the word Hash, making ""source""  for CreateSignature ambiguous.    In the cases where the existing parameter was named ""rgbHash"" (et al) the  ""rgb"" was dropped in the (ReadOnly)Span variant, including in the cases  where the (ReadOnly)Span variant is a proper overload."

27198	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: improve chunked read handling	Today, we only use a single chunk per ReadAsync on the content body.  For example, if we receive a chunked response body like this:    ```  5\r\n  hello\r\n  5\r\n  world\r\n  0\r\n  ```    The first ReadAsync on the response stream will only get the first 5 bytes, even though more bytes are available in subsequent chunks.    We should improve this.  We should process as many chunks are available in the buffer before returning to the user.    Addditionally, we should consider doing a buffered read when we are close to the end of the chunk but haven't fully chunk yet.  For example, assume the initial read on the body causes us to read into the connection read buffer, receiving the following chunks, with the second one incomplete:    ```  5\r\n  hello\r\n  5\r\n  wo  ```    Per above, for the initial read, we should process both chunks and return 7 bytes.    For the next read, we should notice that we are close to the end of the chunk (3 bytes remaining) and do a buffered read on the connection.  This will allow us to process the rest of the current chunk and any additional chunks returned as part of the buffered read.    We should only do unbuffered reads when there are enough bytes remaining in the current chunk to satisfy the requested read size, unless the remaining chunk bytes won't fit in the connection read buffer, in which case we should do an unbuffered read up to the remaining chunk bytes.

There's no easy way to know if a given Platform supports this apart from either hardcoding a list of Platforms, or trying to do it and catching the Exception.    Streams have methods like CanRead/CanWrite/CanSeek to allow developers to verify if something _could_ work before doing it.    I'd like to propose a new static property on FileStream named like `SupportsLocking` than can be cheaply checked, even before creating the FileStream (as the result of this might influence the `FileMode` etc. arguments).    A proposal is [in this commit](https://github.com/mstum/corefx/commit/a9dd5fe07e101807ea0a950ddf9edc9afc3d10ee).

27176	area-System.Net	Modify StreamContent to use default CopyToAsync buffer size when no size is provided	When creating `StreamContent`, users have the option to provide a buffer size or to use our default. This change attempts to improve performance by deferring to the default buffer size chosen in CopyToAsync rather than selecting the default ourselves.    The default buffer size in CopyToAsync is much larger than the default we chose in StreamContent. Deferring to that default greatly improves performance for uploads from slow stream sources like the file system. While it does add some cost for the initial allocation, the larger buffers are then pooled. Users are also still able to specify their own buffer size if they prefer not to use the default.    Some rough performance testing on my machine showed a ~20% decrease in the time it took HttpClient to upload a 20 MB file. That performance testing was based off the code in [this article](http://weblogs.thinktecture.com/pawel/2017/03/aspnet-core-webapi-performance.html), which was the source for the original issue.

If they don't differentiate then it can't write directly to the Pipe as writing a very small chunk followed by a flush in a loop would have an unacceptable performance degradation; so its back to maintaining internal arrays and then writing in a large chunk 😢     /cc @davidfowl @pakrym @stephentoub 
27167	area-System.Numerics	Add a special Numeric structure or INumeric Interface	_Intrinsic_ numeric types (byte, int, float, ….etc) are structures, so unfortunately, they have no base class that can gather all basic methods and operators!   So I suggest to add a special Numeric structure that can accept numeric values of any type. It should contain the value and the underling type of it, as Object class does. Numeric structure should have the basic arithmetic and logical operators. Or it can be an interace (say INumeric) that all numeric data types implement. This will not break any existing code.    Usage:   Numeric structure (or INumeric Inrerface) can be used in generic methods where T is expected to be a numeric type, to carry out the basic arithmetic and logical operators without writing a dozen if statements for each individual numeric type. Objects doesn't have the basic arithmetic and logical operators and have to be converted to numeric types to work with. For example, I tried to do this but failed:      ```    public struct Numeric      {          public object Value { get; set; }            public static Numeric operator +(Numeric n1, Numeric n2)          {              return (Numeric)(n1.Value + n2.Value);          }      }    ```  C# refuses n1.Value + n2.Value because it doesn't know how to add objects. Many if statements are needed to deal with different types of n1 and n2, regarding the larger type to use as the output type. This is a hell of code to something that should be easy and direct if there was a general numeric type that can contain any numeric type.    I face the same situation when I use the base Enum class in any method, because Enum can have any numeric type as an underling type!    I saw similar problem in the source code of Vector<T>, where tons of code lines are repeated just to cover all cases of each numeric type!    Note: If you add the numeric type, C# and VB.net should add a new constraint for generic parameters to be numerics.  where T: numeric  this means T can only be of type Numeric or any intrinsic numeric data types.    So, If this Numeric Type or INumeric Interface exists, one can write  ```  public static Enum SetFlag(Enum value, Enum flag)  {  var result = (Numeric)value | (Numeric)flag);  return (Enum)result;   }  ```    instead of:     ```  public static Enum SetFlags(Enum value, Enum flag)  {     if (Enum.GetUnderlyingType(value.GetType()) == typeof(byte))        return (Enum)(object)((byte)(object)value | (byte)(object)flag);       if (Enum.GetUnderlyingType(value.GetType()) == typeof(int))        return (Enum)(object)((int)(object)value | (int)(object)flag);      //     //     // etc  }  ```    and the same  when writing  generic types that deal with numeric data types only.  This can be extended based on this proposal https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1233, I also suggest to add these interfaces:  numeric constraint.  IIntegral: for integer tyoes (byte, sbyte, int, uint, short, ushort, long, ulong)  IFloating: (float, double, decemal)  IValue: (numerics and dates).  ILetiral (Char and string).  IPrimitive (numerics, dates, char, string)    These Interfaces will make writting generics easier. IPerimative can help you   format or parsing or using + operation depending on where T: IPerimative.   Also it can be usefull when defining generic lists and dictionaries that can contain different values.  This will make them more specialized than using objects.

27164	area-Infrastructure	more love from BenchmarkDotNet to CoreFX	"To tell the long story short: I implemented new toolchain for BenchmarkDotNet which generates a self-contained app which can target **ANY** CoreFX and CoreCLR builds. I combined the knowledge from dogfooding docs from [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dogfooding.md) and [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/workflow/UsingDotNetCli.md). dotnet cli does the job for us, it's just a matter of generating the right `.csproj` and `NuGet.config` files.    So you can now:    1. Benchmark local CoreFX builds  2. Benchmark nightly CoreFX builds  3. Benchmark local CoreCLR builds  4. Benchmark nightly CoreCLR builds  5. Mix them all together  6. Compare them  7. Use Disassembly Diagnoser to get the generated assembly code    To use the new feature you need to add our CI feed to your `NuGet.config` file and download version `0.10.12.433` or newer.    ```xml  <packageSources>    <add key=""bdn-CI"" value=""https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/benchmarkdotnet"" />  </packageSources>  ```    Simple example:    ```cs  public class LocalCoreFxConfig : ManualConfig  {   public LocalCoreFxConfig()   {    Add(Job.ShortRun.With(CustomCoreClrToolchain.CreateForLocalCoreFxBuild(     @""C:\Projects\forks\corefx\bin\packages\Release"",     ""4.5.0-preview2-26313-0"")));      Add(DefaultConfig.Instance.GetExporters().ToArray());    Add(DefaultConfig.Instance.GetLoggers().ToArray());    Add(DefaultConfig.Instance.GetColumnProviders().ToArray());      Add(DisassemblyDiagnoser.Create(new DisassemblyDiagnoserConfig(printAsm: true, recursiveDepth: 2)));   }  }    class Program  {      static void Main(string[] args)           => BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Program).GetTypeInfo().Assembly)              .Run(args, new LocalCoreFxConfig());  }  ```    Comparison:    ```cs  Add(Job.Default.With(CustomCoreClrToolchain.CreateForNightlyCoreFxBuild(""4.5.0-preview2-26214-01"", displayName: ""before my change"")));  Add(Job.Default.With(CustomCoreClrToolchain.CreateForNightlyCoreFxBuild(""4.5.0-preview2-26215-01"", displayName: ""after my change"")));  ```    Complex example:    ```  public class LocalCoreClrConfig : ManualConfig  {   public LocalCoreClrConfig()   {    Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""local builds"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\coreclr\bin\Product\Windows_NT.x64.Release\.nuget\pkg"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26313-0"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\corefx\bin\packages\Release"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26313-0"")    ));      Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""local coreclr myget corefx"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\coreclr\bin\Product\Windows_NT.x64.Release\.nuget\pkg"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26313-0"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26215-01"")    ));      Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""myget coreclr local corefx"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26214-07"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\corefx\bin\packages\Release"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26313-0"")    ));      Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""myget builds"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26214-07"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26215-01"")    ));      // the rest of the config..   }  }  ```    The output is going to contain exact CoreCLR and CoreFX versions used:    ```  BenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.12.20180215-develop, OS=Windows 10 Redstone 3 [1709, Fall Creators Update] (10.0.16299.192)  Intel Core i7-3687U CPU 2.10GHz (Ivy Bridge), 1 CPU, 4 logical cores and 2 physical cores  Frequency=2533308 Hz, Resolution=394.7408 ns, Timer=TSC  .NET Core SDK=2.1.300-preview2-008162    [Host]     : .NET Core 2.0.5 (CoreCLR 4.6.26020.03, CoreFX 4.6.26018.01), 64bit RyuJIT    Job-DHYYZE : .NET Core ?

27161	area-System.Collections	ImmutableArray<byte> .Concat() includes a number of trailing zeroes not present in either argument	".NET Command Line Tools 2.0.2    Hello!  Found a weird problem today, been able to isolate it to the following code sample:    ```C#  using Newtonsoft.Json;  using System;  using System.Collections.Immutable;  using System.Linq;  using System.Text;    namespace ArraySanitycheck  {      class Program      {          public sealed class TestModel          {              public readonly string TestString;              public readonly int TestNumber;                public TestModel(string testString, int testNumber)              {                  TestString = testString;                  TestNumber = testNumber;              }          }            static void Main(string[] args)          {              var model = new TestModel(""Test String Content"", 268234);                var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($""Test Purpose\0{JsonConvert.SerializeObject(model)}"").ToImmutableArray();                var a = bytes.TakeWhile(i => i != 0);              var b = new byte[] { 0 };              var c = bytes.SkipWhile(i => i != 0).Skip(1).Take(5);              var d = new byte[] { 254 };              var e = bytes.SkipWhile(i => i != 0).Skip(6);              var concatenated = a.Concat(b).Concat(c).Concat(d).Concat(e);          }      }  }  ```    Set a breakpoint on the closing brace following `var concatenated...` and inspect `concatenated`.  It ends with approximately 15 zeroes.    Note that none of a, b, c, d or e include said zeroes.    Weirdly, attempting to write this data to the console (`Console.WriteLine(string.Join("", "", concatenated));`) does not include the zeroes either.      I suspect this may be an issue with how TakeWhile/SkipWhile perform ""slices"" of the underlying array (the length of the concatenated array is the same as the length of the sliced array)."

27124	area-System.Text	Regex code optimization candidates	The following items are potential candidates for code optimization which could result in an increased performance / reduced allocation. Based on perfview data and manual code review.    ### Time    - [x] Avoid additional iteration in op code generation (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/26877)  - [x] CharInClass (Internal & Recursive) (12.7% + 7.9% time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexCharClass.cs,787  comments from @danmosemsft: optimizing for common characters [A-Za-z] first? Bloom filter? It's doing a binary search over a short list  comments from myself: I think binary search shouldn't be an issue even for small classes. See this article: https://schani.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/linear-vs-binary-search/  - [x] Stringmatch (6.2 % time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexInterpreter.cs,256  Inline optimization for short case-sensitive strings (default).  `if (str[--c] != _culture.TextInfo.ToLower(runtext[--pos]))` check whether the characters are identical before doing ToLower  - [ ] SetOperator (5.4% time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexInterpreter.cs,148  Store a boolean whether either of those opcodes appear in the pattern at all. Reduces costs to a Boolean check only.  - [ ] Forwardcharnext (3.5% time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexInterpreter.cs,249  The benchmark analyzed by perfview uses case sensitive comparison. I don't know why so much time is spent in this function when it only does two comparisons and an index operation.  - [ ] EnsureStorage (2.3% time spent exclusively, a lot of allocation is done here)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexRunner.cs,345  Though one of the functions is called Stack it's allocating arrays on the Heap. We should investigate how often these array sizes are increased and think about using stackalloc with Span/ValueListBuilder here.  - [x] Analyze failing inlinees  There are probably tons of other places where inline optimizations are applicable.  [System.Text.RegularExpression.Inline.xlsx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1725897/System.Text.RegularExpression.Inline.xlsx)    ### Allocations    In regex-redux there are 3 huge sets of allocations that dominate the rest  - There is a cascade of replacements on a 50M character string, which creates 500MB of string garbage, presumably in LOH  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6385855/36403552-5d9591f0-159a-11e8-9dad-a0df6d71aeff.png)  - Its input file is read into a 100MB string.

If someone wants to collaborate I can share my perfview zip. I will extend this list over time.     FYI @stephentoub @jkotas @joshfree @vancem

27098	area-System.Runtime	.NET 4.7 -  '\0' char in String causes GetHashCode to ignore remainder -- but on x64 only	"@vsfeedback commented on [Mon Feb 12 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780)  The `GetHashCode(...)` function for the **ordinal** `String` comparisons In **.NET 4.7** has a grossly different behavior between running on **x86** versus **x64**. Note: ***I am not talking about the different hash code values, per-platform***, since these are intended as opaque -- rather, the issue here is a ***semantic difference*** in runtime behavior between the two platforms.    On **x86**, the full length of a `String` is always hashed, regardless of any `\0` characters.    On **x64**, the hashing terminates at the first `\0` character.    This is trivial to demonstrate:     var h1 = ""\0AAAAAAAAA"".GetHashCode();   var h2 = ""\0BBBBBBBBBBBB"".GetHashCode();   var h3 = ""\0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC"".GetHashCode();       // x64 results:   //  0x162a16fe   //  0x162a16fe   //  0x162a16fe       // x86 results:   //  0x07b801bc   //  0x048e22a3   //  0x21e2037d    As shown above, this affects the `GetHashCode` instance virtual method (overriden by the `String` type), as well as two other **.NET**-provided techniques for obtaining an ordinal-based `String` hash code: `StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode` and also `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.CompareInfo.GetHashCode` (when using `CompareOptions.Ordinal`). These results are summarized below:    <pre>  -------------------------- x86 --------------------------  &quot;\0AAAAAAAAA&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x07b801bc  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x07b801bc  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x07b801bc      &quot;\0BBBBBBBBBBBB&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x00001505  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x00001505  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x00001505      &quot;\0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x21e2037d  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x21e2037d  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x21e2037d          -------------------------- x64 --------------------------  &quot;\0AAAAAAAAA&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x162a16fe  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x162a16fe  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x162a16fe      &quot;\0BBBBBBBBBBBB&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x162a16fe  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x162a16fe  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x162a16fe      &quot;\0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x162a16fe  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x162a16fe  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x162a16fe  </pre>    While I do realize that theoretical practice deems hash codes purely advisory, in practice applications will be designed to expect that hash code collisions are rare. Being able to trivially produce an infinite number of identical hashes, at will -- such as one can do via &quot;\0A&quot;, &quot;\0B&quot;, &quot;\0C&quot;, &quot;\012345...&quot;  (on **x64** all of these give the same hash code as above, `0x162a16fe`)-- is neither in the spirit of hashing nor accepted/expected common practice.    Worse, this only happens on the  x86 platform and not x64, which could cause considerable loss of design and development effort, if such proceeded based on a false impression of consistent behavior.    _This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/196675/net-47-0-char-in-string-causes-gethashcode-to-igno-1.html  VSTS ticketId: 565715_  _These are the original issue comments:_    Glenn Slayden on 2/9/2018, 06:39 PM (2 days ago): <p>I should also mention that the **x64** version of `String.GetHashCode(...)` in fact makes no reference to the string's length whatsoever, neither to incorporate that value into the hash, nor to determine how many characters to compute the hash code for. Instead, the x64 code ***just scans the string forward until it hits the first '\0' char***. If there are no embedded nulls, then it will scan to the end, where the **CLR** ensures there will always be an extra `\0` char (that is not included in the `Length`).</p><p>Thus, by ignoring the stored length of the string, the x64 code *takes a critical dependency* on that zero-terminating char being present. If that `\0` gets corrupted somehow, the failure mode is severe, since that loop can immediately scan off the end of the string into unrelated memory areas. </p><p>Since the **x86** version refers to the stored string length to determine how many chars to hash--it might seem like that code doesn't have the same problem, and it's true that it's not as fatal, as follows:</p><p>The x86 code does actually take a ***different kind of dependency*** on the zero terminator, namely, that loop is written such that the 16-bit terminator value itself is `XORed` into the returned hash value whenever the two lowest bits of the input string length are equal to `0b_00000011 == 0x03`. For that operation to have no effect, the terminator must be zero (since `xor` with zero is a `nop`.)  So if the terminator somehow becomes corrupted, the returned hash code value will be affected, but there won't likely be an immediate `AccessViolationException` (as with the x64 case).</p>    _These are the original issue solutions:_  (no solutions)  ---  @Joe4evr commented on [Mon Feb 12 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365098562)  Curious, does this also repro for the `OrdinalIgnoreCase` variants?  ---  @jcouv commented on [Mon Feb 12 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365161086)  @AlexGhiondea Could you help route?

The problem is with MSIL code that exists in the `String.GetHashCode` function in mscorlib.dll. The difference between **x64** and **x86** is due to there being different mscorlib.dll builds for each.    ---  @glenn-slayden commented on [Tue Feb 13 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365370873)  @jinujoseph  The 'Area-IDE' tag doesn't sound right; as I mentioned the problem is with runtime code in the Base Class Library.  ---  @jcouv commented on [Tue Feb 13 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365374965)  I'll move the issue over to corefx  "

Several related changes:  (1) Move nonessential code out of LoopbackServer itself. E.g. the websocket test code and the ""transfer"" code. These are only used by a couple very specific tests, and don't actually need to be in LoopbackServer.  (2) Simplify a few things that are awkward today. For example, the Options object gets passed in to several different places and used in different ways. I changed it to only be passed in to CreateServerAsync. Another example: the callback you pass to AcceptSocketAsync always has to return a Task<List>, even though many uses don't care about this and just pass null.  (3) Add the Connection object, which makes the callback from AcceptSocketAsync (now AcceptConnectionAsync) cleaner. Today you have to have four params on the callback, even though you often only care about one or two. Connection just encapsulates these args into a single object, and allows you to easily discover and call instance methods on this object.  (4) Rename some core methods to make them more descriptive.  (5) Fix usage in tests to reflect the updates.    @stephentoub @davidsh @Priya91 @wfurt     "
27086	area-Infrastructure	Tests are not waiting on child processes when run	Some tests use RemoteInvoke to launch child processes. Generally they should call Dispose() on the RemoteInvokeHandle that returns in order to WaitForExit on the process. If they forget, execution will continue and any assertion failure (or other unhandled exception) in the child process will not prevent the test passing. Eg.,:  ```    Running tests...

End time=22:29:15.68, Exit code = 0  ```    This behavior is slightly obscured when running on a dev machine, as runtests.cmd is generally wrapped inside MSBuild, and MSBuild, after WaitforExit hsa returned on the process it launched, will then wait indefinitely for the console output streams to reach EOF. Those do not return until the grandchild remote processes have exited (@JeremyKuhne @stephentoub  I'm unclear why this is - do they automatically duplicate the console handles from the test process which is MSBuild's direct child?). When the grandchild fails in this situation, the exception will appear in the console, but the test will already have succeeded and be counted as such.    When Helix runs the tests using runtest.cmd directly, MSBuild is not involved so if Dispose() is forgotten there is no wait on the grandchildren and they are completely ignored. https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/26543#issuecomment-365021333 is an example.    We should add a finalizer to RemoteInvokeHandle which will mean that at least some waiting will occur on those child processes: they still wont fail the test, as it's too late, but their console output is more likely to show up in the log. (XUnit does not do WaitForPendingFinalizers so I figure if they don't complete within X seconds - I think 40 seconds - of the XUnit process completing, the output still won't show up.)    @stephentoub  does this sound like the best we can do?

27075	area-System.Data	ADO.NET: Database-independent way to generate parameter placeholders	In theory, parameter placeholders [are an entirely database-specific details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/configuring-parameters-and-parameter-data-types#working-with-parameter-placeholders) - there is no way to write a single SQL containing parameters, and then execute it on different databases.    In practice, it seems that most ADO.NET have aligned on the `@name` convention. This is quite a problem, since for databases which don't support it natively, the ADO.NET provider must parse and replace the `@name` placeholder with the one accepted by the database. For example, PostgreSQL uses positional placeholders ($1, $2...), which by the way are also specific to individual statements in a batch (parameters are per-statement, not per-batch).    We could design an API where the provider would generate the placeholder. This could be as simple as adding a `Placeholder` property on DbParameter, which each provider would implement as necessary. The user would then interpolate the placeholder into the CommandText. For positional placeholders, the logic would typically calculate the placeholder as the DbParameter is inserted into a DbParameterCollection, whereas for named placeholders the `ParameterName` would be returned.

27069	area-System.Net	Cache SslClientAuthenticationOptions on SocketsHttpHandler pool	For the common case, we can just use a singleton cached instance with settings computed when the pool is created.  Only if it's accessed via HttpClientHandler with a server certificate callback do we need to still create an instance per request, in order to wrap the delegate to provide the expected semantics.    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @Priya91, @wfurt 
27068	area-System.Net	Fix SocketsHttpHandler connection pool accounting for dropped connections	When MaxConnectionsPerServer is set to anything other than int.MaxValue, the SocketsHttpHandler pool keeps track of the number of connections handed out, and this count is updated when a connection is disposed.  But if a response stream isn't disposed of, resulting in the connection never being disposed of, the count may never be updated.  This fix adds an HttpConnection derived type that simply adds a finalizer, making it pay-for-play when MaxConnectionsPerServer is set to something other than the default.    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @Priya91, @wfurt 
27067	area-System.Net	WinHttpHandler/CurlHandler hangs or fails when connection pooling and connection dropped	See GetAsync_DontDisposeResponse_EventuallyUnblocksWaiters test.  It sets MaxConnectionsPerServer to 1, and then proceeds to issue a ResponseHeadersRead request but drops the response object without disposing it.  It then creates a second request to the same server, and that request is never processed.

27065	area-System.Net	Test failure: GetAsync_CancelPendingRequests_DoesntCancelReadAsyncOnResponseStream	CurlHandler incorrectly maintains a registration with the CancellationToken passed in to SendAsync for the duration of the whole operation, including processing of the response body, even if HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead is used.  That means that HttpClient.CancelAllPending will cancel such operations.  It should unregister from that token once it completes the Task returned from SendAsync.

27063	area-System.Net	Test failure: PostAsync_CancelDuringRequestContentSend_TaskCanceledQuickly	WinHttpHandler has some cancellation support, but it doesn't appear to support cancellation during content send, e.g. if cancellation is requested and the server never sends back response headers.  netfx has the same issue.

Calling Win32 APIs with paths normally will strip these. The exception is when prepended with `\\?\`.  We purposefully do not handle creating these unless you use `\\?\` as creating these sort of paths frequently breaks apps.  We should (and do) handle finding them via `GetFiles`, etc. and handle manipulating them with the *Info classes. We currently don't allow opening them directly from a path string unless you use `\\?\`.

27044	area-Microsoft.CSharp	Make many helpers, factories and tables static in Microsoft.CSharp	Microsoft.CSharp has several objects that are heavily used throughout the library that have circular dependencies on each other, as well as several other classes depending on them. Use of them hence requires either a field in each object that will use them, or to follow chains of such fields. Prior to #25191 it was necessary for them to be instances so that they could be replaced with new versions. This no longer being necessary it's possible to make them all static.    At the same time, the related `RuntimeBinder`, `ExpressionBinder` and `BindingContext` classes are relatively heavy, mostly due to these dependencies. They are hence created once unless a cast must be attempted with a different `BindingContext`, and `BindingContext`'s state is overwritten for each operation. Removing these dependencies makes these very light, allowing them to be `readonly struct`s that are created for each operation.    * Have `TypeArray` in charge of the empty `TypeArray` singleton    * Make `TypeArray` allocation a static responsibility of `TypeArray`    * Remove some orphaned members.    Mostly `BSYMMGR`-returning members that had been used to allocate `TypeArrays`    * Make members static where possible.    Those that can already be easily made static. Includes removing some members that this makes no longer necessary.    * Remove unused parameters    Since some are of the types we'll be making static, and such parameters will have to go anyway.    * Make `TypeTable` static    And more conventional names within `TypeTable`.    * More `TypeManager` state & methods to static    * Make `SYMTBL.Key` an immutable struct.    * `SYMTBL` completely static and renamed to `SymbolStore`    More conventional name, and doesn't clash with other `SymbolTable` class.    * `GetWinRTCollectionIfacesAll` to property.    * `SymFactory` static class.    * Remove `PredefinedTypes._symbolManager` field    Only used in assertion.    * Remove assert comparison with this in `GetAggregate`    Assert is the only reason to not be static, allows a cascade of more changes to static.    * Make `InternalsVisibleTo` check static.    * Make cycle of instance methods static    Take quite a large set of methods which must be instance because of cyclic instance dependencies, and make them all static.    Removes dependency in `AggregateSymbol` and `NullableType` on `TypeManager` instances.    * Replace `GetAggTypeSym` with virtual method on `CType`.    Merged with existing `GetAts` on `NullableType`. Comment says this would be nice, and indeed it would, and its easy now.    * Make those members that can now be static, static.    * Remove orphaned members and fields.    * `PredefinedMembers` entirely static.    * Remove `UserStringBuilder.m_buildingInProgress`    Only used in asserts, just assert on whether `m_strBuilder` is null or not.    Also rename `m_strBuilder` to `_strBuilder` to be more conventional.    * Favour returning over out in `UserStringBuilder`    And favour clearing `StringBuilder` over creating another.    * Make `ErrorHandling` completely static.    Creating `UserStringBuilder` instances on demand.    * `TypeManager` static.    * Make `CNullable` methods static and merge directly into `ExpressionBinder`    Don't cache method and property, as they're already cached.    * Don't preload types.    Either they'll be loaded soon anyway, or else it's a wasted effort.    * Move `CompareTypes` into Better.cs    * Remove `BSYMMGR.LookupAggMember`    Just call into `SymbolStore.LookupSym`    * Move `LookupNextSym` logic into `Symbol`    * Remove `BSYMMGR` and `GlobalSymbolContext`    No longer any use.    * `ExprFactory` static    * `SymbolLoader` static    * `CSemanticChecker` static    * Don't pre-emptively load `System.Object`    Will be loaded as a base of the first type encountered anyway.    * `SymbolTable` static    * More methods can be made static    * Remove orphaned method.    * Move methods for getting `MemberInfo`s from expressions into those expressions    * Replace `ExpressionTreeCallRewriter.GetObject` with virtual property in `Expr`    * `TypeArray` tidy-up.    * Pass `ExpressionBinder` to operator delegates, and make them static.    Allows array to be created once statically, rather than on each instance construction.    * Create `RuntimeBinder`, `ExpressionBinder` and `BindingContext` per operation    These are now very lightweight, so it's simpler to create them anew each time rather than overwriting the values in the `BindingContext`.    * Make `RuntimeBinder`, `ExpressionBinder` and `BindingContext` structs    No need to allocate on the heap.    * Remove `AggregateDeclaration`    We only ever care about the `AggregateSymbol` it relates to.    (The two aren't really separate in dynamic code, where there aren't really declarations).    * Remove `IsChecked` and `CallingContext` from C# binders.    Now not used as they are passed to `RuntimeBinder` on construction, except for `CallingContext` remaining in `CSharpInvokeMemberBinder` for use in deferring.    * Make `RecordBinOpSigFromArgs` static.    A last member that can be made static.    CC @VSadov @OmarTawfik

27033	area-System.Numerics	[Feature-Request] N-bit sized int and floating point types	@hamarb123 commented on [Fri Feb 09 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/647)  I propose we should be able to have N-bit sized int and floating point types.  Here is how it could work:    Obviously we already have the following:  - int 1 / uint 1 (bool)  - uint 8 (byte)  - int 8 (sbyte)  - uint 16, 32 and 64 (ushort, uint and ulong)  - int 16, 32 and 64 (short, int and long)  - float 32 (single)  - float 64 (double)    But what about the following:  - (u)int 2 (2 bits)  - (u)int 4 (4 bits)  - (u)int 128 (128 bits)  - (u)int 256 (256 bits)  - (u)int 2^n (2^n bits)  - (float 1 makes no sense but you could still add it)  - float 2 (2 bits)  - float 4 (4 bits)  - float 8 (8 bits)  - float 16 (16 bits)  - float 128 (128 bits)  - float 256 (256 bits)  - float 2^n (2^n bits)    The classes could be called the following:  For integers: `intj` where j is a power of 2 for a j bit integer  For unsigned integers: `uintj` where j is a power of 2 for a j bit unsigned integer  For floats: `floatj` where j is a power of 2 for a j bit float  And there could be special names for floats between `float8` and `float256` ranging from `quarter`, `half`, `single` (already in .NET), `double` (already in .NET), `quadruple`, `octuple`    Why do I need this in my beloved c#?  1. Because it will give you more/less precise floats to use  2. It will give you more integers to use  3. There are no good floating point (bigger than double) libraries out there that do not just use System.Math which reduces it to double precision anyway    Won't this ruin my IDE with millions of different type names?  1. Not if you make a maximum for the types (say 1024) or make it so that the IDE can have the ability to only show you some (say up to 1024) then it will not give you millions of types suggested  
27031	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler should check for transfer encoding chunked without content	WinHttpHandler and CurlHandler both fail if TransferEncodingChunked is set to true but request.Content is null.  SocketsHttpHandler should check for that, too.  And there should be a test.
27029	area-System.Net	Enable SocketsHttpHandler cancellation support	This change significantly improves the cancellation support in SocketsHttpHandler.  Previously we were passing the CancellationToken around to every method, eventually bottoming out in calls to the underlying Stream which then ends up passing them down to the underlying Socket.  But today Socket's support for cancellation is minimal, only doing up-front checks; if cancellation is requested during the socket operation rather than before, the request will be ignored.  Since HttpClient implements features like timeouts on top of cancellation support, it's important to do better than this.    The change implements cancellation by registering with the CancellationToken to dispose of the connection.  This will cause any reads/writes to wake up.  We then translate resulting exceptions into cancellation exceptions.  When in the main SendAsync method, we register once for the whole body of the operation until the point that we're returning the response message.  For individual operations on the response content stream, we register per operation; however, when feasible we try to avoid the registration costs by only registering if operations don't complete synchronously.  We also account for the case that on Unix, closing the connection may result in read operations waking up not with an exception but rather with EOF, which we also need to translate into cancellation when appropriate.    Along the way I cleaned up a few minor issues as well.    I also added a bunch of cancellation-related tests:  - Test cancellation occurring while sending request content  - Test cancellation occurring while receiving response headers  - Test cancellation occurring while receiving response body and using a buffered operation  - Test that all of the above are triggerable with CancellationTokenSource.Cancel, HttpClient.CancelPendingRequests, and HttpClient.Dispose  - Test cancellation occurring while receiving response body and using an unbuffered operation, either a ReadAsync or CopyToAsync on the response stream  - Test that a CancelPendingRequests doesn't affect unbuffered operations on the response stream    There are deficiencies here in the existing handlers, and tests have been selectively disabled accordingly.  SocketsHttpHandler passes now for all of them.  I will open issues for the non-netfx issues and include the corresponding numbers in comments before merging.    cc: @geoffkizer, @Priya91, @wfurt, @davidsh   Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/23131  Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/23141

That media type does not specify a `charset` parameter, which is unconditionally added in this class.    Adding this parameter automatically is probably not a good idea. I'm not sure the right fix, I just know that `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` will choke some parsers.
27014	area-System.Numerics	Add Vector.Narrow and Vector.Widen overloads to cast elemnts values between float and int, and between double and long	I suggest to add these two overloads to the Vector.Narrow method:  ```  Vector<int> Vector.Narrow(Vector<float>, ConversionType ct)  Vector<long> Vector.Narrow(Vector<double> ConversionType ct)    ```  where:  ```  enum ConversionType  {      Floor,        // Apply Mathf.Floor      Ceiling,     // Apply Mathf.Ceiling      Truncate,   // Apply Mathf.Truncate      Round       // Apply Mathf.Round  }    ```  Example:  ```  var v1 = new Vector<float>({-1.4, 2.1, -3.9, 4.3});  var v2 = Vector.Narrow(v1, ConversionType.Floor);        // <-2, 2, -4, 4>    ```  By the way, It will be nice if we can use foreach to iterate Vector<T> elemnts using foreach..  I think more mathematical methods (like the ones in the Math class) can be added to the Vector class. The fact that the Vector<T> is immutable, demands some long codes to construct a new version containing individual results. Or, is there a chance to make the Indexer read-write?

Here's the test case:        [TestMethod]      public void TestTypeLoadingWithFilePath()      {          var originalType = typeof(SomeClass);          var assemblyAddress = originalType.Assembly.Location;            var loadedAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(assemblyAddress);          Assert.IsNotNull(loadedAssembly);            var loadedType = loadedAssembly.GetType(originalType.FullName);          Assert.IsNotNull(loadedType);            Assert.AreEqual(originalType, loadedType);      }    The test fails on the last assertion.    This only happens on .NET Core on Windows. (I'm testing against latest version, 2.1.4). But this was not the case with .NET Framework.    Is this by design, or a bug?  If it's by design, why?  Again, if it's by design, doesn't this mean different behavior between two implementations of .NET Standard? (.NET Core vs. .NET Framework)
27001	area-System.Memory	API proposal: ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>	## Summary    This proposal simplifies the use of disposable resources shared through code where single owner of the resource is either unclear, or complicates maintenance of the code. This situation is increasingly common when asynchronous code which needs to operate on a threading-agnostic API where the `Dispose` operation is explicitly called out as not safe for concurrent use.    The semantics of a safe, shared wrapper for `IDisposable` objects is challenging, especially when considerations are made for handling missing and/or multiple calls to `Dispose` and for weakly-held references. Providing a holder for managing lifetimes of these objects allows developers to focus on the semantics of the underlying shared object, which is always a challenge in itself.    ## Proposed API    ```csharp  namespace System.Memory  {    public sealed class ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> : IDisposable      where T : class, IDisposable    {      public ReferenceCountedDisposable(T instance);        public T Target { get; }        public ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> TryAddReference();      public void Dispose();        public struct WeakReference      {        public WeakReference(ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> reference);          public ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> TryAddReference();      }    }  }  ```    ## Semantics    A reference-counting wrapper which allows multiple uses of a single disposable object in code, which is deterministically released (by calling `IDisposable.Dispose`) when the last reference is disposed.    Each instance of `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` represents a counted reference (also referred to as a *reference* in the following documentation) to a target object. Each of these references has a lifetime, starting when it is constructed and continuing through its release. During this time, the reference is considered *alive*. Each reference which is alive owns exactly one reference to the target object, ensuring that it will not be disposed while still in use. A reference is released through either of the following actions:    * The reference is explicitly released by a call to `Dispose`.  * The reference is no longer in use by managed code and gets reclaimed by the garbage collector.    While each instance of `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` should be explicitly disposed when the object is no longer needed by the code owning the reference, this implementation will not leak resources in the event one or more callers fail to do so. When all references to an object are explicitly released (i.e. by calling `Dispose`), the target object will itself be deterministically released by a call to `IDisposable.Dispose` when the last reference to it is released. However, in the event one or more references is not explicitly released, the underlying object will still become eligible for non-deterministic release (i.e. finalization) as soon as each reference to it is released by one of the two actions described previously.    When using `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>`, certain steps must be taken to ensure the target object is not disposed early.    1. Use `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` consistently. In other words, do not mix code using reference-counted wrappers with code that references to the target directly.  1. Only use the `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>(T reference)` constructor one time per target object. Additional references to the same target object must only be obtained by calling `TryAddReference`.  1. Do not call `IDisposable.Dispose` on the target object directly. It will be called automatically at the appropriate time, as described above.    All public methods on this type adhere to their pre- and post-conditions and will not invalidate state even in concurrent execution.    ### `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.TryAddReference`    Increments the reference count for the disposable object, and returns a new disposable reference to it. The returned object is an independent reference to the same underlying object. Disposing of the returned value multiple times will only cause the reference count to be decreased once.    Return value: a new `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` pointing to the same underlying object, if it has not yet been disposed; otherwise, `null` if this reference to the underlying object has already been disposed.    ### `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.WeakReference`    Represents a weak reference to a `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` which is capable of obtaining a new counted reference up until the point when the object is no longer accessible.    ### Differences between `TryAddReference` operations    The semantics of `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.TryAddReference` and `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.WeakReference.TryAddReference` are slightly different:    * `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.TryAddReference`: This method returns `null` after *this reference* is disposed. In other words, it is possible for other references to the target object to still be held in code.  * `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.WeakReference.TryAddReference`: This method returns `null` after *the last reference* to the target object is disposed.

26995	area-System.Net	Add DecompressionMethods.Brotli?	"System.Net.DecompressionMethods is an enum that is used by HttpClient handlers to determine whether/what to automatically decode in a response, e.g. if DecompressionMethods.Deflate is set and the response is encoded with deflate, it'll automatically decode the response as part of handing it back.    The enum today is just:  ```C#  namespace System.Net  {      [Flags]      public enum DecompressionMethods      {          None = 0,          GZip = 1,          Deflate = 2      }  }  ```  but we now also have BrotliStream, which we could use to support a DecompressionMethods.Brotli and a ""br"" encoding:  ```C#  namespace System.Net  {      [Flags]      public enum DecompressionMethods      {          ...          Brotli = 4      }  }  ```  From an implementation perspective, this would mean either System.Net.Http.dll taking a dependency on System.IO.Compression.Brotli.dll, or if we wanted to avoid the dependency, building all of the source into System.Net.Http.dll (there is currently a native dependency, with the native portion compiled into clrcompression.dll on Windows and System.IO.Compression.Native.so/dylib on Unix)."

Windows 2008 R2  ```  [headers] => Array  (      [Connection] => Keep-Alive      [Host] => scooterlabs.com  )  ```    Windows 10  ```  [headers] => Array  (      [Connection] => Keep-Alive      [Accept-Encoding] => gzip, deflate      [Host] => scooterlabs.com  )    ```  This works as expected on a Windows 10 box and Windows 8.1 VM.    If you force the headers to be sent however, on Windows 2008 R2 it decompresses fine, so compression is supported.    If you use WebClient or HttpWebRequest directly with `AutomaticDecompression` set it works on all versions with the correct headers and ability to handle the compressed payload.    This works on all environments  ```csharp  var handler = new HttpClientHandler()  {         AutomaticDecompression = DecompressionMethods.GZip | DecompressionMethods.Deflate  };    using (var client = new HttpClient(handler))  {        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.AcceptEncoding.Add(new StringWithQualityHeaderValue(""gzip""));        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.AcceptEncoding.Add(new StringWithQualityHeaderValue(""deflate""));        response = client.GetStringAsync(""http://scooterlabs.com/echo"").Result;  }  ```      P/s: SO question is here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48703143/httpclient-not-sending-accept-encoding-on-different-machine    "

26976	area-System.Reflection	Add support for PDB Checksum debug directory entry	Implements proposal https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26935    The CodeView debug directory entry in PE/COFF file associates the PE file with one or more PDBs. The CodeView entry and the PDB both store the same PDB ID (for Portable PDB it's 20B for Windows PDB it's 16B of data). Debuggers, symbol servers and other tools use the PDB ID to match the PE file with the PDB.     Although the PDB ID is good enough for finding the right PDB for the PE file it is not good enough for validating that the PDB has not been maliciously modified. _PDB Checksum_ is a new debug directory record that can be used for such validation.    _PDB Checksum_ comprises of crypto hash algorithm name and the hash of the PDB content. See   [Specification](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Reflection.Metadata/specs/PE-COFF.md#pdb-checksum-debug-directory-entry-type-19) for details.

26956	area-System.Numerics	Add Quaternion.Divide(Quaternion, float)	I noticed that Quaternion.Divide Method has no overload to dived a quaternion by a scalar value, unlike the Multiply method! so I suggest to add it!  I used this:  ```  Dim Q1 = New Quaternion(1, -1, 2, -4)  Dim Q2 = New Quaternion(-1, 1, -2, -4) * (1 / Q1.LengthSquared())  ```    Edit:  After looking at the Inverse Methode source code, it appears it is the Reciprocal Method but with a confusing name! Inverse in math can mean addative Inverse  or multiplicative inverse. SIMD-enabled types are not consistant with naming conventions of .net. One odd examole is implementing the Length of these types as a method not a property! I expected to find a Quaternion.Reciprocal as there is a Complex.Reciprocal, but found an Inverse method instead. Having a consistant naming convention makes new features easy to learn and thier methods names easy to remember.  Also I think many of static members need to be instance members.
26954	area-System.Runtime	Proposal: TryForSufficientStack method to support stackalloc usage	"_From @kkokosa on February 8, 2018 12:8_  Due to changes in C# 7.2 and Span, more and more `stackalloc `usages may become popular like:    `Span<byte> span = stackalloc byte[1000];`    However, this call will end up with unrecoverable `StackOverflowException `if there is not enough stack space left. We can do nothing in such situation which makes this approach not useful at some point. It is now just completely unreliable to guess what `stackalloc `size may end up with such a catastrophe.    @jkotas pointed out in #14675 that `RuntimeHelpers.EnsureSufficientExecutionStack` is a reliable solution for handling stack overflow in general but as MSDN says, this method ""_ensures that the remaining stack space is large enough to execute the average .NET Framework function_"". However, probing for _average_ .NET framework function is not very helpful as `stackalloc` makes it not average for sure.     I propose to add a new helper method which gives at least some clue whether our `stackalloc `may end up with `StackOverflowException`:    `public static bool RuntimeHelpers.TryForSufficientStack(long size)`    I believe returning `bool` instead of throwing an exception (like `InsufficientExecutionStackException` from above method) is better because `stackalloc` is most probably used in hot paths already and adding exception handling there is rather undesirable.    As far as I understand this method seems to be quite simple in terms of implementation as all necessary data are there already. My naive implementation proposal:    ```  FCIMPL1(FC_BOOL_RET, ReflectionInvocation::TryForSufficientStack, INT64 size)  {      FCALL_CONTRACT;        Thread *pThread = GetThread();        UINT_PTR current = reinterpret_cast<UINT_PTR>(&pThread);      UINT_PTR limit = reinterpret_cast<UINT_PTR>(pThread->GetCachedStackLimit());        FC_RETURN_BOOL(current >= (limit + size));  }  FCIMPLEND  ```    PS. I am not sure whether stack guard size should be taken into consideration here or not...   _Copied from original issue: dotnet/coreclr#16277_"

## About

ML.NET is a cross-platform open-source machine learning framework which makes machine learning accessible to .NET developers.

For more information, see the [ML.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/).

This package adds the ability to load and run pre-trained TensorFlow models as part of your ML.NET pipeline.

## Key Features

* Any type of TensorFlow model can be run with all the data interop handled automatically.


## How to Use

See [Machine Learning Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples) for an assortment of samples that show how to get started using ML.NET.

## Main Types

Some of the types provided by this library are:

* `Microsoft.ML.Transforms.TensorFlowModel`
* `Microsoft.ML.Transforms.TensorFlowTransformer`
* `Microsoft.ML.Transforms.TensorFlowEstimator`

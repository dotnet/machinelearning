    /// needed by the mapper to compute its output. The <see cref="ISchemaBoundRowMapper"/> is an extention to this interface, that
    /// can also produce an output IRow given an input IRow. The IRow produced generally contains only the output columns of the mapper, and not
    /// the input columns (but there is nothing preventing an <see cref="ISchemaBoundRowMapper"/> from mapping input columns directly to outputs).

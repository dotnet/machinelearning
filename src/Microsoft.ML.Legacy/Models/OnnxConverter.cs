        /// <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> is an intermediate representation format
        /// for machine learning models. It is used to make models portable such that you can
        /// train a model using a toolkit and run it in another tookit's runtime, for example,
        /// you can create a model using ML.NET, export it to an ONNX-ML model file,
        /// then load and run that ONNX-ML model in Windows ML, on an UWP Windows 10 app.
        ///
        /// This API converts an ML.NET model to ONNX-ML format by inspecting the transform pipeline
        /// from the end, checking for components that know how to save themselves as ONNX.
        /// The first item in the transform pipeline that does not know how to save itself
        /// as ONNX, is considered the "input" to the ONNX pipeline. (Ideally this would be the
        /// original loader itself, but this may not be possible if the user used unsavable
        /// transforms in defining the pipe.) All the columns in the source that are a type the
        /// ONNX knows how to deal with will be tracked. Intermediate transformations of the
        /// data appearing as new columns will appear in the output block of the ONNX, with names
        /// derived from the corresponding column names. The ONNX JSON will be serialized to a
        /// path defined through the Json option.
        ///
        /// This API supports the following arguments:
        /// <see cref="Onnx"/> indicates the file to write the ONNX protocol buffer file to. This is required.
        /// <see cref="Json"/> indicates the file to write the JSON representation of the ONNX model. This is optional.
        /// <see cref="Name"/> indicates the name property in the ONNX model. If left unspecified, it will
        /// be the extension-less name of the file specified in the onnx indicates the protocol buffer file
        /// to write the ONNX representation to.
        /// <see cref="Domain"/> indicates the domain name of the model. ONNX uses reverse domain name space indicators.
        /// For example com.microsoft.cognitiveservices. This is a required field.
        /// <see cref="InputsToDrop"/> is a string array of input column names to omit from the input mapping.
        /// A common scenario might be to drop the label column, for instance, since it may not be practically
        /// useful for the pipeline. Note that any columns depending on these naturally cannot be saved.
        /// <see cref="OutputsToDrop"/> is similar, except for the output schema. Note that the pipeline handler
        /// is currently not intelligent enough to drop intermediate calculations that produce this value: this will
        /// merely omit that value from the actual output.
        ///

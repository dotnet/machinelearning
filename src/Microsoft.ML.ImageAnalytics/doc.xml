          ## Remarks 
          The images might be converted to grayscale to reduce the complexity of the model.
          The grayed out images contain less information to process than the colored images.
          Another use case for converting to grayscale is to generate new images out of the existing ones, so you can have a larger dataset,        
          a technique known as [data augmentation](http://www.stat.harvard.edu/Faculty_Content/meng/JCGS01.pdf)</a>.

      <summary>
        Extracts the pixels from the input images and, converts them into a vector of numbers. This can be further used as feature by the algorithms added to the pipeline.   
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The ImagePixelExtractingEstimator extracts the pixels from the input images and, converts them into a vector of numbers.
        This can be further used as feature by the algorithms added to the pipeline.

        ImagePixelExtractingEstimator expects a <see cref="ImageResizingEstimator"/>  in the pipeline, before it is used.

    <member name="ImageResizingEstimator">
      <summary>
        Resizes the images to a new width and height. 
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        In image processing pipelines, often machine learning practitioners make use of <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mlserver/2017/04/12/image-featurization-with-a-pre-trained-deep-neural-network-model/">pre-trained DNN featurizers</a> to
        extract features for usage in the machine learning algorithms.
        Those pre-trained models have a defined width and height for their input images, so often, after getting loaded, the images will need to get resized before
        further processing.

        <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/tree/master/samples/csharp/getting-started">examples in the machinelearning-samples github repository.</a>

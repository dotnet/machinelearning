## About

ML.NET is a cross-platform open-source machine learning framework which makes machine learning accessible to .NET developers.

For more information, see the [ML.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/).

This package adds the ability to use LightGBM based transformers, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms.

## Key Features

* Classification/Categorization - Automatically divide customer feedback into positive and negative categories
* Regression/Predict continuous values - Predict the price of houses based on size and location
* Recommendations - Suggest products that online shoppers may want to buy, based on their previous purchases

## How to Use

See [Machine Learning Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples) for an assortment of samples that show how to get started using ML.NET.

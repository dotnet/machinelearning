    // NOTE:
    // This is a temporary workaround for https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34602 or until TextLoader is rearchitected.
    // BlockingCollection is fairly efficient for blocking producer/consumer scenarios, but it was optimized for scenarios where
    // they're not created/destroyed quickly.  Its CompleteAdding mechanism is implemented internally in such a way that if a
    // taker is currently blocked when CompleteAdding is called, that taker thread will incur an OperationCanceledException that's
    // eaten internally.  If such an exception is only happening rarely, it's not a big deal, but the way TextLoader uses
    // BlockingCollections, they can end up being created and destroyed very frequently, tens of thousands of times during the
    // course of an algorithm like SDCA (when no caching is employed).  That in turn can result in tens of thousands of exceptions
    // getting thrown and caught. While in normal processing even that number of exceptions results in an overhead that's not
    // particularly impactful, things change when a debugger is attached, as that makes the overhead of exceptions several orders
    // of magnitude higher (e.g. 1000x). Until either TextLoader is rearchitected to not create so many BlockingCollections in these
    // situations, or until this implementation detail in BlockingCollection is changed, we use a replacement BlockingQueue implementation,
    // that's similar in nature to BlockingCollection (albeit without many of its bells and whistles) but that specifically doesn't
    // rely on cancellation for its CompleteAdding mechanism, and thus doesn't incur this impactful exception. Other than type name, this
    // type is designed to expose the exact surface area required by the existing usage of BlockingCollection<T>, no more, no less,
    // making it easy to swap in and out.

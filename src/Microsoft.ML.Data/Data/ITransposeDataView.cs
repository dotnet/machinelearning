    // REVIEW: There are a couple problems. Firstly, what to do about cases where
    // the number of rows exceeds int.MaxValue? Right now we just fail. Practically this makes
    // little difference; if we suppose the major user of this is FastTree, it can't handle
    // nearly that many examples anyway, but other applications may arise. (One possible solution:
    // do not return a slot type, but return a row count, and have the getter accessor be able
    // to define a slot range. Or a paged dataview, but that seems more involved.)

    /// by row in a typical dataview. A slot-accessible column can be accessed with a slot-by-slot

    /// <see cref="RowCursor"/>). This interface is intended to be implemented by classes that

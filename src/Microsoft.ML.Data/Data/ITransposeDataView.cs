    // REVIEW: There are a couple problems. Firstly, what to do about cases where
    // the number of rows exceeds int.MaxValue? Right now we just fail. Practically this makes
    // little difference; if we suppose the major user of this is FastTree, it can't handle
    // nearly that many examples anyway, but other applications may arise. (One possible solution:
    // do not return a slot type, but return a row count, and have the getter accessor be able
    // to define a slot range. Or a paged dataview, but that seems more involved.)

    /// A view of data where columns can optionally be accessed slot by slot, as opposed to row
    /// by row in a typical dataview. A slot-accessible column can be accessed with a slot-by-slot
    /// cursor via an <see cref="SlotCursor"/> returned by <see cref="GetSlotCursor(int)"/>
    /// (naturally, as opposed to row-by-row through an <see cref="DataViewRowCursor"/>). This interface
    /// is intended to be implemented by classes that want to provide an option for an alternate
    /// way of accessing the data stored in a <see cref="IDataView"/>.
    ///
    /// The interface only advertises that columns may be accessible in slot-wise fashion. The i-th column
    /// is accessible in this fashion iff <see cref="GetSlotType"/> with col=i doesn't return <see langword="null"/>.

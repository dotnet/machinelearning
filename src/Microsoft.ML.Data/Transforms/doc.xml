      <summary>
        Removes missing values from vector type columns.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        This transform removes the entire row if any of the input columns have a missing value in that row.
        This preprocessing is required for many ML algorithms that cannot work with missing values.
        Useful if any missing entry invalidates the entire row.
        If the <see cref="P:Microsoft.ML.Transforms.MissingValuesRowDropper.Complement"/> is set to true, this transform would do the exact opposite,
        it will keep only the rows that have missing values.

        Handle missing values by replacing them with either the default value or the indicated value.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        This transform handles missing values in the input columns. For each input column, it creates an output column
        where the missing values are replaced by one of these specified values:
        <list type='bullet'>
          <item>
            <description>The default value of the appropriate type.</description>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>The mean value of the appropriate type.</description>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>The max value of the appropriate type.</description>
          </item>
          <item>
            <description>The min value of the appropriate type.</description>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>The last three work only for numeric/TimeSpan/DateTime kind columns.</para>
        <para>
          The output column can also optionally include an indicator vector for which slots were missing in the input column.
          This can be done only when the indicator vector type can be converted to the input column type, i.e. only for numeric columns.
        </para>
        <para>
          When computing the mean/max/min value, there is also an option to compute it over the whole column instead of per slot.
          This option has a default value of true for variable length vectors, and false for known length vectors.
          It can be changed to true for known length vectors, but it results in an error if changed to false for variable length vectors.

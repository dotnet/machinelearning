      <summary>
        Removes missing values from vector type columns.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        This transform emoves the entire row if any of the input columns have a missing value in that row.
        This preprocessing is required for many ML algorithms that cannot work with missing values.
        Useful if any missing entry invalidates the entire row.
        If the <see cref="Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Data.NAFilter.Defaults.Complement"/> is set to true, this transform would do the exact opposite,
        it will keep only the rows that have missing values.

      <summary>
        Converts input values (words, numbers, etc.) to index in a dictionary.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The TextToKeyConverter transform builds up term vocabularies (dictionaries).
        The TextToKey Converter and the <see cref="T:Microsoft.ML.Transforms.HashConverter"/> are the two one primary mechanisms by which raw input is transformed into keys.
        If multiple columns are used, each column builds/uses exactly one vocabulary (dictionary).
        The output columns are KeyType-valued.
        The Key value is the one-based index of the item in the dictionary.
        If the key is not found in the dictionary, it is assigned the missing value indicator.
        This dictionary mapping values to keys is most commonly learnt from the unique values in input data,
        but can be defined through other means: either with the mapping defined directly on the command line, or as loaded from an external file.
